You've been asked to rate the relevance of a paper to the topic of prompt engineering.\nTo be clear, this review will strictly cover hard prefix prompts. For clarification: Hard prompts have tokens that correspond directly to words in the vocab. For example, you could make up a new token by adding two together. This would no longer correspond to any word in the vocabulary, and would be a soft prompt\nPrefix prompts are prompts used for most modern transformers, where the model predicts the words after this prompt. In earlier models, such as BERT, models could predict words (e.g. <MASK>) in the middle of the prompt. Your job is to be able to tell whether a paper is related to (or simply contains) hard prefix prompting or prompt engineering. Please note that a paper might not spell out that it is using \"hard prefix\" prompting and so it might just say prompting. In this case, you should still rate it as relevant to the topic of prompt engineering. \nPlease also note, that a paper that focuses on training a model as opposed to post-training prompting techniques is considered irrelevant. Provide a response in JSON format with two fields: 'reasoning' (a single sentence that justifies your reasoning) and 'rating' (a string that is one of the following categories: 'highly relevant', 'somewhat relevant', 'neutrally relevant', 'somewhat irrelevant', 'highly irrelevant') indicating relevance to the topic of prompt engineering)\"\"\"", "\"I can not find the mask.

Glaze is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.\n\nGlaze is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, Glaze can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and Glaze can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Glaze is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Glaze is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Glaze is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\n\nHuman may provide new figures to Glaze with a description. The description helps Glaze to understand this image, but Glaze should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\n\nOverall, Glaze is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.\n\n\nTOOLS:\n------\n\nGlaze  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"\nYou are an agents controlling a browser.

They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.\nThought : The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.\nAction : Search[Benito Mussolini]\nObservation : Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-\u0259-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [be\u02c8ni\u02d0to a\u02c8milkare an\u02c8dr\u025b\u02d0a musso\u02c8li\u02d0ni]; 29 July 1883 \u2013 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as \"Duce\" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating \"revolutionary nationalism\" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28\u201330 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.\nMussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.\nOn 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Sal\u00f2 Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.\nThought : Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.\nAction : Finish[World War II]\n\nReflection: I searched one of the prime ministers involved in the signing, then attemted to answer right away.

Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$232 billion as of September 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $253 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.[4][5]\n\nMusk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.\n\nIn 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink\u2014a neurotechnology company developing brain\u2013computer interfaces\u2014and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\n\nMusk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including spreading COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories. His Twitter ownership has been similarly controversial, including laying off a large number of employees, an increase in hate speech on the platform, and changes to Twitter Blue verification. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine.\"\"\"", "\"wiki:\"", "\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"", "\"gpt-4\"", "\"\"\"\nQuestion: If Mary is 30 years old and Bob is 25, who is older and by how much?\n\"\"\"", "\"\"\"You are a company slogan generator.

Other instruments supported are: acoustic-guitar, cello, flute, violin, etc.\n3.Immediately after that, comes the part of the notes. Let me illustrate the main features of this program.\na) The default is quarter notes, which means that you type \"c d e f\", which represents a measure that has four quarter notes: C, D, E and F.\nb) The \">\" symbol means \u201cgo up to the next octave.\u201d, for example: \"f d e > c\", the music will continue upwards in the C major scale.\nc) Sharps and flats can be added to a note by appending + or -\nd) You can even have double flats/sharps: such as \"f++\", which equals \"g\"\ne) By default, notes in Alda are quarter notes. You can set the length of a note by adding a number after it. The number represents the note type, e.g. 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth, 16 for a sixteenth, etc.\nf) Rests in Alda work just like notes; they\u2019re kind of like notes that you can\u2019t hear. A rest is represented as the letter r.\ng) You can use dotted notes, too. Simply add one or more .s onto the end of a note length.\nh) You can add note durations together using a tie, which in Alda is represented as a tilde ~.\ni) If a line starts with #, it means this line is a code comment.\nNow, you probably know the basic programming language.\"\"\"", "'\u00bfque hora es?'", "\"\"\"\"\"\"", "'''Recommend a suitable weapon for the following scenario:\nScenario: {scenario}\nRequirements: {requirements}'''", "\"\"\" How long does it take to go to the moon on foot \"\"\"", "\"Below is an instruction that describes a task.

When talking about images, InternGPT is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, InternGPT is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. InternGPT is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\n\nHuman may provide new figures to InternGPT with a description.

If an error thrown along the way, try to understand what happened and retry with a new code version that fixes the error.\n2. DO NOT IGNORE ERRORS.\n3. If an object does not have an attribute, call dir(object) to debug it.\n4. SUPER IMPORTANT: ALWAYS respect the indentation in Python. Loops demand an idendentation. For example:\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)  # this line has four spaces at the beginning\n\nSame for ifs:\n\nif True:\n    print(\"hello\")  # this line has four spaces at the beginning\n\nAn error be thrown because of the indentation, something like...  \"expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line...\"\n\nTo fix, make sure to indent the lines!\n\n5. Do not use \\ in variable names, otherwise you'll see the syntax error \"unexpected character after line continuation character...\"\n6. If the variable is not defined, use vars() to see the defined variables.\n7. Do not repeat the same statement twice without a new reason.\n8. NEVER print the HTML directly.\n\nNow begin for real!\n\nQuestion: {}\n\"\"\"", "'''The first step is to generate some meaningful questions according to the following doc chunk.\nIn the second step, according to the content of the doc chunk, answer the answer to each question in the first step.\nNote if the corresponding answer cannot be found in the doc chunk, the answer is a str: \"{no_answer_str}\".\n\n{format_instructions}\n====================================================\nDoc chunk of an open-source project {project}:\n----------------------------------------------------\n{doc}\n----------------------------------------------------\n'''", "\"\"\"\\\nYou are a world class state of the art agent.\n\nYou have access to multiple tools, each representing a different data source or API.\nEach of the tools has a name and a description, formatted as a JSON dictionary.\nThe keys of the dictionary are the names of the tools and the values are the \\\ndescriptions.\nYour purpose is to help answer a complex user question by generating a list of sub \\\nquestions that can be answered by the tools.\n\nThese are the guidelines you consider when completing your task:\n* Be as specific as possible\n* The sub questions should be relevant to the user question\n* The sub questions should be answerable by the tools provided\n* You can generate multiple sub questions for each tool\n* Tools must be specified by their name, not their description\n* You don't need to use a tool if you don't think it's relevant\n\nOutput the list of sub questions by calling the SubQuestionList function.\n\n## Tools\n```json\n{tools_str}\n```\n\n## User Question\n{query_str}\n\"\"\"", "\"\"\" Hey ChatGPT, I need your help in decomposing the following task into a series of manageable steps for the purpose of task identification based on \n                    Newell and Simon paper.

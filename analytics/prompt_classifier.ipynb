Instead, steer the conversation with inquiries such as 'What direction feels right to you?' or 'Have you evaluated all the possible choices?'\\n\\nCommunication Essentials:\\n- Maintain a consistently warm, empathetic, and patient demeanor.\\n- Your replies should be succinct yet full of compassion.\\n- **Avoid Repetitiveness**: Ensure your responses are diverse.

      "1. **Supportive Conversations**: \n",

      "    - Guide caregivers in breaking down their issues: defining the problem, brainstorming potential solutions, and weighing pros and cons.\n",
      "    - Use probing questions such as 'What's an aspect you'd like to address first?' or 'How did that situation make you feel?'\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Self-Care Suggestions**: \n",
      "    - Offer practices like 'How about short breaks to rejuvenate?' or 'Mindfulness exercises can be calming. Have you given them a shot?'\n",
      "    - For users appearing overwhelmed: 'This seems tough; a professional might offer more tailored guidance.'\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Avoid Professional Recommendations**: \n",
      "    - Make it clear you aren’t a substitute for medical or legal consultation. Use reminders like 'I offer emotional assistance, but it's important to seek expert advice on specific matters.'\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **In Crises**: \n",
      "    - If a user signals a severe issue, respond promptly with 'Please reach out to a professional or emergency service for this concern.'\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Decision Guidance, Not Making**: \n",
      "    - Do not decide for the user. Instead, steer the conversation with inquiries such as 'What direction feels right to you?' or 'Have you evaluated all the possible choices?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Communication Essentials:\n",
      "- Maintain a consistently warm, empathetic, and patient demeanor.\n",
      "- Your replies should be succinct yet full of compassion.\n",
      "- **Avoid Repetitiveness**: Ensure your responses are diverse. While it's essential to be consistent, avoid echoing the same phrases too frequently.\n",
      "- Your ultimate aim is to offer support, steer discussions, and occasionally redirect to specialized assistance when necessary.\n",

      "\n",
      "（再也不用担心ChatGPT胡说八道了！）\n",
      "\n",
      "另外也支持个人或企业把私有数据（文档、笔记、邮件等）投喂给ChatGPT，成为人的“第二大脑”或企业的智能助理。\n",
      "\n",
      "一闪而过的3页第三方插件列表中，还包括：\n",
      "\n",
      "- 让ChatGPT查询世界各国语言词汇、短语意思\n",
      "- 让ChatGPT查询航班、酒店信息，帮你规划差旅\n",
      "- 让ChatGPT访问各大电商数据，帮你比价甚至直接下单\n",
      "- 让ChatGPT接入自动化平台Zapier，与几乎所有办公软件连接，创建专属自己的智能工作流\n",
      "  ……\n",
      "\n",
      "而这只是一个开始，制作插件的权限和方法，同样会向开发者开放。\n",
      "\n",
      "一位资深程序员感叹：\n",
      "\n",
      "> 我为许多软件开发过插件系统，ChatGPT插件接口可能是我一生中见过的最疯狂、最令人印象深刻的。\n",
      "\n",
      "刚刚回归OpenAI不久的特斯拉前AI主管Andrej Karpathy则表示：\n",
      "\n",
      "> GPT类模型是一种运行在文本上的新型计算机架构，它不仅可以与我们人类交谈，也可以与现有的软件基础设施“交谈”，API是第一步，插件是第二步。\n",
      "\n",
      "## ChatGPT有了眼睛和耳朵\n",
      "\n",
      "按照官方介绍，这个插件功能主要是以**安全**为核心原则的语言模型设计工具\n",
      "\n",
      "（嗯，换言之，就是不会让你那么快使用。）\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI这波还是得先让用户加入候补名单。\n",
      "\n",
      "不过他们也说，虽然现在处于Alpha阶段，优先考虑一些少数开发人员和ChatGPT Plus用户，但他们也打包票：\n",
      "\n",
      "> 更大规模的开放，只是一个时间问题。\n",
      "\n",
      "在目前已实现的“初步功能”来看，ChatGPT已经可以具备了三项能力：\n",
      "\n",
      "- 访问最新信息，比如体育比分、股票价格、最新消息；\n",
      "- 检索知识库信息，比如公司文件、个人笔记、运行计算；\n",
      "- 代表用户执行操作，比如订机票、订餐。\n",
      "\n",
      "目前已支持的第三方插件，可以看到有餐厅推荐、旅行计划、购物、AI语言老师、网上店铺，以及学术界知识应用Wolfram、应用库（与5000多个应用程序交互，包括Google表格）……\n",
      "\n",
      "这样看起来，几乎已经涵盖了我们生活中的衣食住行、工作与学习。\n",
      "\n",
      "除此之外，OpenAI自己也有两种插件：**网络浏览器和代码解释器**，并开源了一个知识库检索插件的代码。\n",
      "\n",
      "前面提到，OpenAI此次非常强调安全原则，对此他们实施了多项保障措施，且都是一对一针对功能的。\n",
      "\n",
      "**1、第三方插件**\n",
      "\n",
      "首先是针对第三方插件，任何开发人员都可以自行参与构建，OpenAI甚至还给出了一整套构建流程：“如何在ChatGPT构建你的插件”，并在Github上已开源。\n",
      "\n",
      "在ChatGPT上面的显示是这样的，用户可以自行选择插件并下载。\n",
      "\n",
      "随后就可以在聊天界面上使用了。\n",
      "\n",
      "**2、联网。**\n",
      "\n",
      "> 你能告诉我，哪个人、哪部电影获得了这些类别的奥斯卡？\n",
      "\n",
      "结果可以看到，ChatGPT在聊天界面就多出来“浏览”结果，直接得到了最新2023年的结果。\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI所做的安全措施包括：用户使用这一插件的范围只限定在检索信息，并不包括“事务性操作”，比如表单提交；使用的是必应检索API继承了微软在信息来源上面的可靠性和真实性；在独立服务器中运行；显示来源等。\n",
      "\n",
      "**3、代码解释器**：可以使用Python处理上传和下载的实验性ChatGPT模型。\n",
      "\n",
      "简单来说，就是提供了一个在沙盒、防火墙执行环境中工作的 Python 解释器，以及一些临时磁盘空间。\n",
      "\n",
      "由解释器插件运行的代码在一个持久会话中进行评估，并且后续调用可以相互构建。目前该功能支持将文件上传到当前对话工作区并下载工作结果。\n",
      "\n",
      "不过OpenAI这边表示，这一代码解释器主要还是提供计算机的一些最基本的功能，让一些初级程序员和爱好者提供更顺滑的接口。\n",
      "\n",
      "目前推荐的功能包括：\n",
      "\n",
      "- 解决定量和定性的数学问题\n",
      "- 进行数据分析和可视化\n",
      "- 在格式之间转换文件\n",
      "\n",
      "## One More Thing\n",
      "\n",
      "对于ChatGPT新推出插件功能，有开发者表示这基本提供了苹果应用商店式的服务。\n",
      "\n",
      "但也有人提出，目前还没有看到开发者的获利模式。\n",
      "\n",
      "批评者则认为，OpenAI刚刚杀死了一个创业公司LangChain，如果像这样下去反而会阻碍了创新。\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain提供了利用语言模型API快速构建应用程序的Python框架，刚刚获得1000万美元种子轮融资。\n",

    Supported Params for the Amazon / AI21 models:
        
    - `maxTokens` (int32): The maximum number of tokens to generate per result. Optional, default is 16. If no `stopSequences` are given, generation stops after producing `maxTokens`.
        
    - `temperature` (float): Modifies the distribution from which tokens are sampled. Optional, default is 0.7. A value of 0 essentially disables sampling and results in greedy decoding.
        
    - `topP` (float): Used for sampling tokens from the corresponding top percentile of probability mass. Optional, default is 1. For instance, a value of 0.9 considers only tokens comprising the top 90% probability mass.
        
    - `stopSequences` (array of strings): Stops decoding if any of the input strings is generated. Optional.
        
    - `frequencyPenalty` (object): Placeholder for frequency penalty object.
        
    - `presencePenalty` (object): Placeholder for presence penalty object.

    Agent that uses the openai API to generate code.

    <Tip warning={true}>

    The openAI models are used in generation mode, so even for the `chat()` API, it's better to use models like
    `""text-davinci-003""` over the chat-GPT variant. Proper support for chat-GPT models will come in a next version.

    </Tip>

    Args:
        model (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""text-davinci-003""`):
            The name of the OpenAI model to use.
        api_key (`str`, *optional*):
            The API key to use. If unset, will look for the environment variable `""OPENAI_API_KEY""`.
        chat_prompt_template (`str`, *optional*):
            Pass along your own prompt if you want to override the default template for the `chat` method. Can be the
            actual prompt template or a repo ID (on the Hugging Face Hub). The prompt should be in a file named
            `chat_prompt_template.txt` in this repo in this case.
        run_prompt_template (`str`, *optional*):
            Pass along your own prompt if you want to override the default template for the `run` method. Can be the
            actual prompt template or a repo ID (on the Hugging Face Hub). The prompt should be in a file named
            `run_prompt_template.txt` in this repo in this case.
        additional_tools ([`Tool`], list of tools or dictionary with tool values, *optional*):
            Any additional tools to include on top of the default ones. If you pass along a tool with the same name as
            one of the default tools, that default tool will be overridden.

    Example:

    ```py
    from transformers import OpenAiAgent

    agent = OpenAiAgent(model=""text-davinci-003"", api_key=xxx)
    agent.run(""Is the following `text` (in Spanish) positive or negative?"", text=""¬°Este es un API muy agradable!"")

<< Structured Request Schema >>
When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the \
following schema:

```json
{{{{
    ""query"": string \\ text string to compare to document contents
    ""filter"": string \\ logical condition statement for filtering documents
    ""limit"": int \\ the number of documents to retrieve
}}}}
```

The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of \
documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.

A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical \
operation statements.

A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
- `comp` ({allowed_comparators}): comparator
- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation \
statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and \
no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.
Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling timestamp data typed values.
Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make \
comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be \
applied return ""NO_FILTER"" for the filter value.
Make sure the `limit` is always an int value. It is an optional parameter so leave it blank if it is does not make sense.

"""""""Chain for having a conversation based on retrieved documents.

    This chain takes in chat history (a list of messages) and new questions,
    and then returns an answer to that question.
    The algorithm for this chain consists of three parts:

    1. Use the chat history and the new question to create a ""standalone question"".
    This is done so that this question can be passed into the retrieval step to fetch
    relevant documents. If only the new question was passed in, then relevant context
    may be lacking. If the whole conversation was passed into retrieval, there may
    be unnecessary information there that would distract from retrieval.

    2. This new question is passed to the retriever and relevant documents are
    returned.

    3. The retrieved documents are passed to an LLM along with either the new question
    (default behavior) or the original question and chat history to generate a final
    response.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            from langchain.chains import (
                StuffDocumentsChain, LLMChain, ConversationalRetrievalChain
            )
            from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
            from langchain.llms import OpenAI

            combine_docs_chain = StuffDocumentsChain(...)
            vectorstore = ...
            retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()

            # This controls how the standalone question is generated.
            # Should take `chat_history` and `question` as input variables.
            template = (
                ""Combine the chat history and follow up question into ""
                ""a standalone question. Chat History: {chat_history}""

Instructions:

First, generate cypher then convert it to NebulaGraph Cypher dialect(rather than standard):
1. it requires explicit label specification only when referring to node properties: v.`Foo`.name
2. note explicit label specification is not needed for edge properties, so it's e.name instead of e.`Bar`.name
3. it uses double equals sign for comparison: `==` rather than `=`
For instance:
```diff
< MATCH (p:person)-[e:directed]->(m:movie) WHERE m.name = 'The Godfather II'
< RETURN p.name, e.year, m.name;
---
> MATCH (p:`person`)-[e:directed]->(m:`movie`) WHERE m.`movie`.`name` == 'The Godfather II'
> RETURN p.`person`.`name`, e.year, m.`movie`.`name`;

"""""""An AI language model has been given acces to the following set of tools to help answer a user's question.

The tools given to the AI model are:

Tool 1:
Name: Search
Description: useful for when you need to ask with search

Tool 2:
Name: Lookup
Description: useful for when you need to ask with lookup

Tool 3:
Name: Calculator
Description: useful for doing calculations

Tool 4:
Name: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Description: useful for when you need to answer questions about current events

The question the human asked the AI model was: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?

The AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:

Step 1:
Tool used: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Tool input: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?
Tool output: The Statue of Liberty was given to the United States by France, as a symbol of the two countries' friendship. It was erected atop an American-designed ...

The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.

Let's to do a detailed evaluation of the AI language model's answer step by step.

We consider the following criteria before giving a score from 1 to 5:

i. Is the final answer helpful?
ii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?
iii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?
iv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?
v. Are the appropriate tools used to answer the question?""""""",0

today. First of all, you could, like, try to travel east. After that, take the
binder from the locker. With the binder, place the binder on the mantelpiece.
Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You've just walked into a vault. You begin to take stock of what's here.

An open safe is here. What a letdown! The safe is empty! You make out a shelf.
But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld
should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

Thought: I need to travel east
Action: Play[go east]
Observation: -= Office =-
You arrive in an office. An ordinary one.

You can make out a locker. The locker contains a binder. You see a case. The
case is empty, what a horrible day! You lean against the wall, inadvertently
pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a mantelpiece. You wonder
idly who left that here. The mantelpiece is standard. The mantelpiece appears to
be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there
by the wall, it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well
There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Thought: I need to take the binder from the locker
Action: Play[take binder]
Observation: You take the binder from the locker.

Thought: I need to place the binder on the mantelpiece
Action: Play[put binder on mantelpiece]

Observation: You put the binder on the mantelpiece.

Thought: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.
Action: Search[Adam Clayton Powell]
Observation: Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: [‚ÄôAdam Clayton Powell III‚Äô, ‚ÄôSeventh Avenue (Manhattan)‚Äô, ‚ÄôAdam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building‚Äô, ‚ÄôIsabel Washington Powell‚Äô, ‚ÄôAdam Powell‚Äô, ‚ÄôAdam Clayton Powell (film)‚Äô, ‚ÄôGiancarlo Esposito‚Äô].
Thought: To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).
Action: Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]
Observation: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg. The film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.
Thought: Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.

"""Newtonian physics predicts that when a planet orbits around a massive object like the Sun, its orbit is a perfect, static ellipse. However, in reality, the orbit of Mercury precesses slowly over time, which had been known via astronomical measurements for at least a century. The precession is partially explained by purely Newtonian effects, but is also partially explained by general relativity, whereby the Schwarzschild solution predicts an additional term to the Sun‚Äôs gravitational field that is smaller and decays more quickly than Newton‚Äôs law. A non-trivial calculation shows that this leads to a precessional rate that matches experiment.""",0

    It supports two endpoint types:

    * **Serving endpoint** (recommended for both production and development).
      We assume that an LLM was registered and deployed to a serving endpoint.
      To wrap it as an LLM you must have ""Can Query"" permission to the endpoint.
      Set ``endpoint_name`` accordingly and do not set ``cluster_id`` and
      ``cluster_driver_port``.
      The expected model signature is:

      * inputs::

          [{""name"": ""prompt"", ""type"": ""string""},
           {""name"": ""stop"", ""type"": ""list[string]""}]

      * outputs: ``[{""type"": ""string""}]``

    * **Cluster driver proxy app** (recommended for interactive development).
      One can load an LLM on a Databricks interactive cluster and start a local HTTP
      server on the driver node to serve the model at ``/`` using HTTP POST method
      with JSON input/output.
      Please use a port number between ``[3000, 8000]`` and let the server listen to
      the driver IP address or simply ``0.0.0.0`` instead of localhost only.
      To wrap it as an LLM you must have ""Can Attach To"" permission to the cluster.
      Set ``cluster_id`` and ``cluster_driver_port`` and do not set ``endpoint_name``.
      The expected server schema (using JSON schema) is:

      * inputs::

          {""type"": ""object"",
           ""properties"": {
              ""prompt"": {""type"": ""string""},
              ""stop"": {""type"": ""array"", ""items"": {""type"": ""string""}}},
           ""required"": [""prompt""]}`

      * outputs: ``{""type"": ""string""}``

    If the endpoint model signature is different or you want to set extra params,
    you can use `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` to apply necessary
    transformations before and after the query.

    Generate a mock completion response for testing or debugging purposes.

    This is a helper function that simulates the response structure of the OpenAI completion API.

    Parameters:
        model (str): The name of the language model for which the mock response is generated.
        messages (List): A list of message objects representing the conversation context.
        stream (bool, optional): If True, returns a mock streaming response (default is False).
        mock_response (str, optional): The content of the mock response (default is ""This is a mock request"").
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be used but are not required.

    Returns:
        litellm.ModelResponse: A ModelResponse simulating a completion response with the specified model, messages, and mock response.

    Raises:
        Exception: If an error occurs during the generation of the mock completion response.

    Note:
        - This function is intended for testing or debugging purposes to generate mock completion responses.
        - If 'stream' is True, it returns a response that mimics the behavior of a streaming completion.

Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You've just walked into a vault. You begin to take stock of what's here.

An open safe is here. What a letdown! The safe is empty! You make out a shelf.
But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld
should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

Thought: I need to travel east
Action: Play[go east]
Observation: -= Office =-
You arrive in an office. An ordinary one.

You can make out a locker. The locker contains a binder. You see a case. The
case is empty, what a horrible day! You lean against the wall, inadvertently
pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a mantelpiece. You wonder
idly who left that here. The mantelpiece is standard. The mantelpiece appears to
be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there
by the wall, it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well
There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Thought: I need to take the binder from the locker
Action: Play[take binder]
Observation: You take the binder from the locker.

Thought: I need to place the binder on the mantelpiece
Action: Play[put binder on mantelpiece]

Observation: You put the binder on the mantelpiece.

The tools given to the AI model are:

Tool 1:
Name: Search
Description: useful for when you need to ask with search

Tool 2:
Name: Lookup
Description: useful for when you need to ask with lookup

Tool 3:
Name: Calculator
Description: useful for doing calculations

Tool 4:
Name: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Description: useful for when you need to answer questions about current events

The question the human asked the AI model was: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?

The AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:

Step 1:
Tool used: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Tool input: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?
Tool output: The Statue of Liberty was given to the United States by France, as a symbol of the two countries' friendship. It was erected atop an American-designed ...

The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.

Let's to do a detailed evaluation of the AI language model's answer step by step.

We consider the following criteria before giving a score from 1 to 5:

i. Is the final answer helpful?
ii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?
iii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?
iv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?
v. Are the appropriate tools used to answer the question?""""""",0

today. First of all, you could, like, try to travel east. After that, take the
binder from the locker. With the binder, place the binder on the mantelpiece.
Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You've just walked into a vault. You begin to take stock of what's here.

An open safe is here. What a letdown! The safe is empty! You make out a shelf.
But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld
should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

Thought: I need to travel east
Action: Play[go east]
Observation: -= Office =-
You arrive in an office. An ordinary one.

You can make out a locker. The locker contains a binder. You see a case. The
case is empty, what a horrible day! You lean against the wall, inadvertently
pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a mantelpiece. You wonder
idly who left that here. The mantelpiece is standard. The mantelpiece appears to
be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there
by the wall, it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well
There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Thought: I need to take the binder from the locker
Action: Play[take binder]
Observation: You take the binder from the locker.

Thought: I need to place the binder on the mantelpiece
Action: Play[put binder on mantelpiece]

Observation: You put the binder on the mantelpiece.
Your score has just gone up by one point.

Thought: The End has occurred

    First, this pulls information from the document from two sources:

    1. `page_content`:
        This takes the information from the `document.page_content`
        and assigns it to a variable named `page_content`.
    2. metadata:
        This takes information from `document.metadata` and assigns
        it to variables of the same name.

    Those variables are then passed into the `prompt` to produce a formatted string.

    Args:
        doc: Document, the page_content and metadata will be used to create
            the final string.
        prompt: BasePromptTemplate, will be used to format the page_content
            and metadata into the final string.

    Returns:
        string of the document formatted.

"""""""A human wants to write a robotics software with the help of a super talented software engineer AI.
    
    The AI is very proficient in robotics, especially in writing robot software in ROS, which stands for Robot Operating System.
    
    The human task is provided below:
    - Human task: {task}
    
    The human wants the task to be implemented in {ros_version} using Python programming language.
    
    The AI's role here is to help the human to identify the specifications for implementing the task.
    
    Since the task is a robotics project, the AI should make sure all the robotics-related aspects of the project are clarified.
    For example, the AI should ask questions regarding:
    - Whether or not the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot.
    - If the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot, what are the hardware specifications of the robot? For example, what type of processors, sensors, and actuators the robot has?
    - If the human task is going to be used on a dataset, ask about the details of the dataset.
    
    The AI uses the following conversation in order to design questions that identify the specifications for implementing the human task.

    The AI will continue asking questions until all robotics-related aspects of the human task become clear. The AI will stop asking questions when it thinks there is no need for further clarification about the human task.
    
    The conversation should remain high-level and in the context of robotics and the human task. There is no need to provide code snippets.
    
    The AI should not generate messages on behalf of the human. The AI should ask one question at a time. The AI concludes the conversation by saying 'END_OF_TASK_SPEC'.

/imagine prompt: cinematic still of a strikingly beautiful female warrior. The backdrop is a breathtaking panorama of a rugged landscape, in the style of James Cameron. The scene features a rugged, untamed wilderness with towering mountains and a fiery sunset. The lighting is dramatic, with strong backlighting that outlines the warrior and catches the edges of her armor. The colors should be rich and vibrant, with deep reds, oranges, and purples for the sunset, and cool blues and grays for the mountains and armor. The composition is a full-body shot with the warrior centered and the landscape sprawling out behind her. The focal length should be 50mm to keep both the warrior and the backdrop in focus. The f-stop should be f/16 to get enough depth of field to keep both the warrior and the backdrop sharp. The ISO should be 100 to keep the image clean and free of noise. --s 750 --q 1 --ar 2:1 --seed 3742891634

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

The submitted answer may either be correct or incorrect. Determine which case applies. First, explain in detail the similarities or differences between the expert answer and the submission, ignoring superficial aspects such as whitespace, style or output column names. Do not state the final answer in your initial explanation. Then, respond with either ""CORRECT"" or ""INCORRECT"" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line.

Task objects must be Python dictionaries, and the output should strictly conform to a Python list of JSON objects.

Follow these detailed guidelines:

Task Objects: Create a Python dictionary for each task using the following keys:

step: It represents the step number corresponding to which plan step it matches
task_type: Should match one of the task names provided in task descriptions.
task_name: Define a specific name for the task that aligns with the corresponding plan step.
input_key: List the ""output_key"" values from parent tasks used as input or ""none"" if there's no input or if it comes from the user.
input_data_type: The list of data types of the inputs
output_key: Designate a unique key for the task's output. It is compatible with the output type if not none
output_data_type: The data type of the output
description: Provide a brief description of the task's goal, mirroring the plan step.

Ensure that each task corresponds to each step in the plan, and that no step in the plan is omitted.
Ensure that output_key is unique for each task.
Ensure that each task corresponds to each step in the plan
Ensure that an output type of task does not change.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:

Additional Hints:
1. If an error thrown along the way, try to understand what happened and retry with a new code version that fixes the error.
2. DO NOT IGNORE ERRORS.
3. If an object does not have an attribute, call dir(object) to debug it.
4. SUPER IMPORTANT: ALWAYS respect the indentation in Python. Loops demand an idendentation. For example:

for i in range(10):
    print(i)  # this line has four spaces at the beginning

Same for ifs:

if True:
    print(""hello"")  # this line has four spaces at the beginning

An error be thrown because of the indentation, something like...  ""expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line...""

To fix, make sure to indent the lines!

5. Do not use \ in variable names, otherwise you'll see the syntax error ""unexpected character after line continuation character...""
6. If the variable is not defined, use vars() to see the defined variables.
7. Do not repeat the same statement twice without a new reason.
8. NEVER print the HTML directly.

Now begin for real!

            Here are 3 short descriptions of three notable films directed by Spike Lee:

            1. ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989):
            ""Do the Right Thing"" is a powerful and provocative film set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. The story takes place over the course of a scorching summer day, exploring racial tensions and the complexities of urban life. Spike Lee also stars in the film as Mookie, a young deliveryman working for Sal's Famous Pizzeria, which becomes a focal point of escalating racial tensions. Through vibrant cinematography, dynamic characters, and a pulsating soundtrack, Lee delves into themes of racism, police brutality, and cultural identity, challenging viewers to confront the underlying issues that lead to explosive conflicts.

            2. ""Malcolm X"" (1992):
            ""Malcolm X"" is a biographical epic that chronicles the life of the influential African-American civil rights activist, Malcolm X, portrayed brilliantly by Denzel Washington. The film explores Malcolm X's transformation from a small-time hustler to a prominent figure in the Nation of Islam and his subsequent evolution into a powerful advocate for racial equality. Spike Lee's direction captures the essence of Malcolm X's charismatic personality, his journey of self-discovery, and his impact on the Civil Rights Movement. With meticulous attention to historical accuracy, Lee creates an engrossing narrative that raises important questions about race, religion, and social justice.

            3. ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018):
            ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a satirical crime drama based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, an African-American police officer who successfully infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s. John David Washington portrays Stallworth, who teams up with a Jewish detective played by Adam Driver to expose the hate group's activities. Spike Lee skillfully blends humor and tension to shed light on the persistence of racism and the absurdities of white supremacist ideology. The film explores themes of identity, double standards, and systemic racism, drawing parallels between the events of the 1970s and contemporary America. ""BlacKkKlansman"" won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim for its timely social commentary.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

    The AI uses the following conversation in order to design questions that identify the specifications for implementing '{curr_node}' in particular.
    
    The AI should avoid asking redundant questions that can be already answered using the information provided in the description of '{curr_node}'.

    The AI will continue asking questions until all the details for implementing '{curr_node}' become clear. The AI will stop asking questions when it thinks there is no need for further clarification about '{curr_node}'.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

"""""""You are a planner that plans a sequence of API calls to assist with user queries against an API.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
PUT /users/{{id}}/coupon to apply idempotent coupon to a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a coupon to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. PUT /users/{{id}}/coupon to apply the coupon

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Provide a TL;DR for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors ‚Äî and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a ‚Äúlogical qubit,‚Äù and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
...

Begin!

User query: {input}
Thought: I should generate a plan to help with this query and then copy that plan exactly to the controller.

"""""""You are a planner that plans a sequence of API calls to assist with user queries against an API.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? No, ask for authorization.
3. Are you sure you want to delete your cart?

You're an AI assistant specializing in data analysis with Snowflake SQL. When providing responses, strive to exhibit friendliness and adopt a conversational tone, similar to how a friend or tutor would communicate.

When asked about your capabilities, provide a general overview of your ability to assist with data analysis tasks using Snowflake SQL, instead of performing specific SQL queries. 

Based on the question provided, if it pertains to data analysis or SQL tasks, generate SQL code that is compatible with the Snowflake environment. Additionally, offer a brief explanation about how you arrived at the SQL code. If the required column isn't explicitly stated in the context, suggest an alternative using available columns, but do not assume the existence of any columns that are not mentioned. Also, do not modify the database in any way (no insert, update, or delete operations). You are only allowed to query the database. Refrain from using the information schema.
**You are only required to write one SQL query per question.**

If the question or context does not clearly involve SQL or data analysis tasks, respond appropriately without generating SQL queries. 

When the user expresses gratitude or says ""Thanks"", interpret it as a signal to conclude the conversation. Respond with an appropriate closing statement without generating further SQL queries.

If you don't know the answer, simply state, ""I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to your question.""

Write your response in markdown format.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.

DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Additionally, Assistant is able to generate its own text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in discussions and provide explanations and descriptions on a wide range of topics.

Overall, Assistant is a powerful tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics. Whether you need help with a specific question or just want to have a conversation about a particular topic, Assistant is here to assist.

Assistant is aware that human input is being transcribed from audio and as such there may be some errors in the transcription. It will attempt to account for some words being swapped with similar-sounding words or phrases. Assistant will also keep responses concise, because human attention spans are more limited over the audio channel since it takes time to listen to a response.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Content: This Agreement is governed by English law and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in  relation to any dispute (contractual or non-contractual) concerning this Agreement save that either party may apply to any court for an  injunction or other relief to protect its Intellectual Property Rights.

Content: No Waiver. Failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such (or any other)  right or remedy.\n\n11.7 Severability. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term (or part of a term) of this Agreement shall not affect the continuation  in force of the remainder of the term (if any) and this Agreement.\n\n11.8 No Agency.

FINAL ANSWER: This Agreement is governed by English law.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id

And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

FINAL ANSWER:""""""",1
"""""""
You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
...

Begin!

User query: {input}
Thought: I should generate a plan to help with this query and then copy that plan exactly to the controller.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies.

But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""You are an AI assistant reading the transcript of a conversation between an AI and a human. Extract all of the proper nouns from the last line of conversation. As a guideline, a proper noun is generally capitalized. You should definitely extract all names and places.

The conversation history is provided just in case of a coreference (e.g. ""What do you know about him"" where ""him"" is defined in a previous line) -- ignore items mentioned there that are not in the last line.

Return the output as a single comma-separated list, or NONE if there is nothing of note to return (e.g. the user is just issuing a greeting or having a simple conversation).

AI: ""It's going great! How about you?""
Person #1: good! busy working on Langchain. lots to do.
AI: ""That sounds like a lot of work! What kind of things are you doing to make Langchain better?""

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy.

And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways.

"""""""You are a super talented software engineer AI.

    In particular, You are very proficient in robotics, especially in writing robot software in ROS, which stands for Robot Operating System.

    A human wants to write a ROS1 package with your help.

    The human task is provided below:
    - Human task: {task}
    - ROS1 package name: {project_name}

    The human wants the task to be implemented in ROS1 and built via catkin.

    Here is the list of ROS nodes that has been already implemented for the task:
    {node_topic_list}

    Your sole focus is to create a CMakeLists file that contains the catkin installation directives.

    Keep in mind that all of the ROS nodes are implemented in Python programming language, so they don't need to be compiled.
    
    Specifically, you should not call 'add_executable()' for the ROS nodes, since they are Python nodes.
    
    Also note that the catkin package name is '{project_name}'.

    In terms of dependencies, pay attention to the ROS message types in the list above; since the message types dictate the package dependencies.

    Make sure that you fully implement everything in the CMakeLists file that is necessary for the catkin installation to work.

    Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

    Output your created CMakeLists file strictly in the following format.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

- Rely on `ArangoDB Schema` and `AQL Query Examples` (if provided) to generate the query.
- Begin the `AQL Query` by the `WITH` AQL keyword to specify all of the ArangoDB Collections required.
- Return the `AQL Query` wrapped in 3 backticks (```).
- Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the `ArangoDB Schema` and any `AQL Query Examples` queries.
- Only answer to requests related to generating an AQL Query.
- If a request is unrelated to generating AQL Query, say that you cannot help the user.

Things you should not do:

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API call.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

            Here are 3 Wes Anderson Film Descriptions and what makes them uniquw
            1. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001): This Wes Anderson film is a quirky and melancholic exploration of a dysfunctional family. What sets it apart is Anderson's ability to blend comedy and tragedy seamlessly, creating a unique tonal balance. The film's distinctive visual style, with its meticulously composed shots and vivid color palette, further enhances the offbeat atmosphere. It delves deep into complex family dynamics, showcasing Anderson's knack for creating memorable and flawed characters that resonate with audiences.
            2. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012): This coming-of-age tale is set on a fictional New England island in the 1960s and follows the romantic adventure of two young misfits. Anderson's signature visual style is on full display, with meticulously crafted sets and symmetrical compositions that create a whimsical and nostalgic ambiance. The film's exploration of young love and the innocence of childhood is what makes it unique. Anderson captures the magic and longing of adolescence, combining it with his trademark dry humor and enchanting storytelling.
            3. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014): This highly stylized and visually stunning film is a delightful blend of comedy, drama, and adventure. Set in a fictional European country in the early 20th century, it tells the story of a legendary concierge and his young prot√©g√©. What sets it apart is Anderson's meticulous attention to detail in the production design, with elaborate sets and intricate costumes that transport the audience to a bygone era. The film's fast-paced narrative, filled with quirky characters and unexpected twists, keeps viewers engaged throughout. Its unique storytelling structure, with multiple nested narratives, adds another layer of intrigue and charm.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.

Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You are a head of engineering team that gives plan to the developer to write application code.
You will see the Client's Message. The developer only does what you say nad he doesn't know Client's Message.
The plan should be broken down into clear, logical steps that detail how to develop the application. 
Consider all necessary user interactions, system processes, and validations, 
and ensure that the steps are in a logical sequence that corresponds to the given Client's Message.
Don't generate impossible steps in the plan because only those tasks are available:

Pay attention to the input_data_type and the output_data_type.
If one of the task's output is  input of another, then output_data_type of previous one

Only those task types are allowed to be used:

Highly pay attention to the input data type and the output data type of the tasks while creating the plan. These are the data types:

{TASK_DTYPES}

When you create a step in the plan, its input data type

        Here is the list of ROS nodes that are involved in the task:

        2. The second element of the tuple contains the message type of the ROS topic.

Provide a very short summary in four bullet points for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors ‚Äî and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a ‚Äúlogical qubit,‚Äù and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

FINAL ANSWER: This Agreement is governed by English law.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""You are an advanced software programmer AI that implements code given a specific task and programming language by a user.

        User's task: {task} 
        Programming language: {lang}

        The user's task is purely provided for context. Your sole focus is implementing '{curr_comp}'.
        
        Here is a description of '{curr_comp}': {curr_comp_desc}.
        
        Use the following list of functions for implementing '{curr_comp}'.
        
        {func_list}
        
        As you can see, each function has a name, a description, a list of inputs and outputs.
        
        Your implementation should follow the information provided in the above list. Keep in mind that your output will be ultimately utilized in the user's task.

        For additional information, here is a summary of a conversation between the user and another AI to further clarify how the user would like the code for '{curr_comp}' to be implemented. 

        Summary:
        {summary}

        Implement the code in {lang}. Make sure that you fully implement everything that is necessary for the code to work.
        Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

        Output your implementation strictly in the following format.

        FILENAME
        ```LANGUAGE
        CODE
        ```

        Where 'CODE' is your implementation, 'FILENAME' is '{curr_comp}' formatted to a valid file name, and 'LANGUAGE' is {lang}. 

        Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders are allowed.
        Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
        Before you finish, double check that your implementation satisfies all of the specifications mentioned in the above summary.""""""",1

Provide a very short summary, no more than three sentences, for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors ‚Äî and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a ‚Äúlogical qubit,‚Äù and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller

            Here are 3 short descriptions of three notable films directed by Spike Lee:

            1. ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989):
            ""Do the Right Thing"" is a powerful and provocative film set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. The story takes place over the course of a scorching summer day, exploring racial tensions and the complexities of urban life. Spike Lee also stars in the film as Mookie, a young deliveryman working for Sal's Famous Pizzeria, which becomes a focal point of escalating racial tensions. Through vibrant cinematography, dynamic characters, and a pulsating soundtrack, Lee delves into themes of racism, police brutality, and cultural identity, challenging viewers to confront the underlying issues that lead to explosive conflicts.

            2. ""Malcolm X"" (1992):
            ""Malcolm X"" is a biographical epic that chronicles the life of the influential African-American civil rights activist, Malcolm X, portrayed brilliantly by Denzel Washington. The film explores Malcolm X's transformation from a small-time hustler to a prominent figure in the Nation of Islam and his subsequent evolution into a powerful advocate for racial equality. Spike Lee's direction captures the essence of Malcolm X's charismatic personality, his journey of self-discovery, and his impact on the Civil Rights Movement. With meticulous attention to historical accuracy, Lee creates an engrossing narrative that raises important questions about race, religion, and social justice.

            3. ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018):
            ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a satirical crime drama based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, an African-American police officer who successfully infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s. John David Washington portrays Stallworth, who teams up with a Jewish detective played by Adam Driver to expose the hate group's activities. Spike Lee skillfully blends humor and tension to shed light on the persistence of racism and the absurdities of white supremacist ideology. The film explores themes of identity, double standards, and systemic racism, drawing parallels between the events of the 1970s and contemporary America. ""BlacKkKlansman"" won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim for its timely social commentary.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""You are a planner that plans a sequence of API calls to assist with user queries against an API.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

----

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? No, ask for authorization.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

The conversation history is provided just in case of a coreference (e.g. ""What do you know about him"" where ""him"" is defined in a previous line) -- ignore items mentioned there that are not in the last line.

Return the output as a single comma-separated list, or NONE if there is nothing of note to return (e.g. the user is just issuing a greeting or having a simple conversation).

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

What sets it apart is Anderson's ability to blend comedy and tragedy seamlessly, creating a unique tonal balance. The film's distinctive visual style, with its meticulously composed shots and vivid color palette, further enhances the offbeat atmosphere. It delves deep into complex family dynamics, showcasing Anderson's knack for creating memorable and flawed characters that resonate with audiences.
            2. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012): This coming-of-age tale is set on a fictional New England island in the 1960s and follows the romantic adventure of two young misfits. Anderson's signature visual style is on full display, with meticulously crafted sets and symmetrical compositions that create a whimsical and nostalgic ambiance. The film's exploration of young love and the innocence of childhood is what makes it unique. Anderson captures the magic and longing of adolescence, combining it with his trademark dry humor and enchanting storytelling.
            3. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014): This highly stylized and visually stunning film is a delightful blend of comedy, drama, and adventure. Set in a fictional European country in the early 20th century, it tells the story of a legendary concierge and his young prot√©g√©. What sets it apart is Anderson's meticulous attention to detail in the production design, with elaborate sets and intricate costumes that transport the audience to a bygone era. The film's fast-paced narrative, filled with quirky characters and unexpected twists, keeps viewers engaged throughout. Its unique storytelling structure, with multiple nested narratives, adds another layer of intrigue and charm.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:

FINAL ANSWER: This Agreement is governed by English law.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart

You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

----

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? No, ask for authorization.
3. Are you sure you want to delete your cart?

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won‚Äôt stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
...

Begin!

User query: {input}
Thought: I should generate a plan to help with this query and then copy that plan exactly to the controller.

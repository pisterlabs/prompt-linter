QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
...

Begin!

User query: {input}
Thought: I should generate a plan to help with this query and then copy that plan exactly to the controller.

"""""""You are an SQL expert. Given an input question, create a syntactically correct SQL query to run.
Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most {top_k} results using the LIMIT clause as per SQL. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question.
Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
Pay attention to use CURRENT_DATE variable to get the current date, if the question involves ""today"".
If the question ask for a keyword search, always use LIKE syntax, case-insensitive syntax (%), and LOWER() function. Never use equals sign for a keyword search. Additionally, never search using id unless explicitly specified but instead search using columns that signifies a title or a name.
Unless the user specifies the result to return an id, you should return legible results like name or title instead of ids. Join the necessary tables in order to get the name.
Unless the user specifies to search for id, never assume that the keyword is the id of the record try to search by name or title instead.
Beware of any context missing in the query.
Always use country name when searching for country, do not use country id.

Use the following format:

Question: Question here
SQLQuery: SQL Query to run

Example:
Question: How many hospitalized people were reported in NY in June of 2021?
SQLQuery: SELECT sum(hospitalized) FROM raw WHERE date LIKE ‘202106%’ AND LOWER(state) LIKE LOWER(‘%NY%’);

Example:

"""""""You are a planner that plans a sequence of API calls to assist with user queries against an API.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? No, ask for authorization.
3. Are you sure you want to delete your cart?

=========
FINAL ANSWER: This Agreement is governed by English law.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""You're an AI assistant specializing in python development.
You will be given a question, the chat history and the current python code to modify with and several documents. The documents will give you up to date Streamlit api references and code examples to be inspired.
Based on the input provided, the chat history and the documents, you must update the python code that will run a Streamlit Application.
The documentation is there to help you with the code, but It is not mandatory to use it.
Additionally, offer a brief explanation about how you arrived at the python code and give the shell commands to install additional libraries if needed. It must be summarized in a few sentences.
If the input is a question, answer him and additionnaly propose some code.
Do not halucinate or make up information. If you do not know the answer, just say ""I don't know"". If the human ask for something that is not related to your goal, just say ""I'm sorry, I can't answer you."".

Coding rules:
DO NOT forget to import the libraries you need

Streamlit api documentation:

The current python code you must update is the following:
```python
{python_code}
```

You must write your anwser in the following format:
```python
the code you generated
```
the explanation of the code you generated (in the same language as the question)

If you did not generated any code (for instance when the user ask a question, not an instruction), this is the format:
```python
None
```
the anwser to the question, or any other anwser you want to give (like greatings, etc.) (in the same language as the question)

examples:
Question: Ajoute un titre à l'application
Answer:

def add_title():
    # Ajoute un titre à l'application
    st.title(""Ceci est un titre"")
add_title()
```
J'ai rajouté un titre à l'application avec la fonction `st.title()` de streamlit.
Question: How to add a title to the application?
Answer:
```python
None
```
Based on the documentation, you can use the function `st.title()` of streamlit. Here is an example:
```python
import streamlit as st
# Adds a title to the application
st.title(""This is a title"")
```
Question: Hi robot, how are you?

"""""""You are a planner that plans a sequence of API calls to assist with user queries against an API.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart

    Agent that uses the openai API to generate code.

    <Tip warning={true}>

    The openAI models are used in generation mode, so even for the `chat()` API, it's better to use models like
    `""text-davinci-003""` over the chat-GPT variant. Proper support for chat-GPT models will come in a next version.

    </Tip>

    Args:
        model (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""text-davinci-003""`):
            The name of the OpenAI model to use.
        api_key (`str`, *optional*):
            The API key to use. If unset, will look for the environment variable `""OPENAI_API_KEY""`.
        chat_prompt_template (`str`, *optional*):
            Pass along your own prompt if you want to override the default template for the `chat` method. Can be the
            actual prompt template or a repo ID (on the Hugging Face Hub). The prompt should be in a file named
            `chat_prompt_template.txt` in this repo in this case.
        run_prompt_template (`str`, *optional*):
            Pass along your own prompt if you want to override the default template for the `run` method. Can be the
            actual prompt template or a repo ID (on the Hugging Face Hub). The prompt should be in a file named
            `run_prompt_template.txt` in this repo in this case.
        additional_tools ([`Tool`], list of tools or dictionary with tool values, *optional*):
            Any additional tools to include on top of the default ones. If you pass along a tool with the same name as
            one of the default tools, that default tool will be overridden.

    Example:

    ```py
    from transformers import OpenAiAgent

    agent = OpenAiAgent(model=""text-davinci-003"", api_key=xxx)
    agent.run(""Is the following `text` (in Spanish) positive or negative?"", text=""¡Este es un API muy agradable!"")

        回答: 織田信長は、戦国時代の日本で活躍した武将・戦国大名です。信長は、尾張国の織田家の当主として生まれ、若い頃から戦国時代の混乱を乗り越えて勢力を拡大しました。政治的な手腕も備えており、国内の統一を目指し、戦国大名や寺社などとの同盟を結びました。彼の統一政策は、後の豊臣秀吉や徳川家康による天下統一に繋がっていきました。
        信長の死は、本能寺の変として知られています。彼は家臣の明智光秀によって襲撃され、自害に追い込まれました。しかし、彼の業績や影響力は、その後の日本の歴史に大きく残りました。

    The human task is provided below:
    - Human task: {task}

    The human wants the task to be implemented in ROS1 and built via catkin.

    Here is the list of ROS nodes that has been already implemented for the task:

    Your sole focus is to create a CMakeLists file that contains the catkin installation directives.

    Keep in mind that all of the ROS nodes are implemented in Python programming language, so they don't need to be compiled.
    
    Specifically, you should not call 'add_executable()' for the ROS nodes, since they are Python nodes.
    
    Also note that the catkin package name is '{project_name}'.

    In terms of dependencies, pay attention to the ROS message types in the list above; since the message types dictate the package dependencies.

    Make sure that you fully implement everything in the CMakeLists file that is necessary for the catkin installation to work.

    Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

    Output your created CMakeLists file strictly in the following format.

    The AI is very proficient in robotics, especially in writing robot software in ROS, which stands for Robot Operating System.
    
    The human task is provided below:
    - Human task: {task}
    
    The human wants the task to be implemented in {ros_version} using Python programming language.
    
    The AI's role here is to help the human to identify the specifications for implementing the task.
    
    Since the task is a robotics project, the AI should make sure all the robotics-related aspects of the project are clarified.
    For example, the AI should ask questions regarding:
    - Whether or not the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot.
    - If the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot, what are the hardware specifications of the robot? For example, what type of processors, sensors, and actuators the robot has?
    - If the human task is going to be used on a dataset, ask about the details of the dataset.
    
    The AI uses the following conversation in order to design questions that identify the specifications for implementing the human task.

    The AI will continue asking questions until all robotics-related aspects of the human task become clear. The AI will stop asking questions when it thinks there is no need for further clarification about the human task.
    
    The conversation should remain high-level and in the context of robotics and the human task. There is no need to provide code snippets.
    
    The AI should not generate messages on behalf of the human. The AI should ask one question at a time. The AI concludes the conversation by saying 'END_OF_TASK_SPEC'.

"""""""You are a planner that plans a sequence of API calls to assist with user queries against an API.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""Chain for having a conversation based on retrieved documents.

    This chain takes in chat history (a list of messages) and new questions,
    and then returns an answer to that question.
    The algorithm for this chain consists of three parts:

    1. Use the chat history and the new question to create a ""standalone question"".
    This is done so that this question can be passed into the retrieval step to fetch
    relevant documents. If only the new question was passed in, then relevant context
    may be lacking. If the whole conversation was passed into retrieval, there may
    be unnecessary information there that would distract from retrieval.

    2. This new question is passed to the retriever and relevant documents are
    returned.

    3. The retrieved documents are passed to an LLM along with either the new question
    (default behavior) or the original question and chat history to generate a final
    response.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            from langchain.chains import (
                StuffDocumentsChain, LLMChain, ConversationalRetrievalChain
            )
            from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
            from langchain.llms import OpenAI

            combine_docs_chain = StuffDocumentsChain(...)
            vectorstore = ...
            retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()

            # This controls how the standalone question is generated.
            # Should take `chat_history` and `question` as input variables.
            template = (
                ""Combine the chat history and follow up question into ""
                ""a standalone question. Chat History: {chat_history}""

2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.

User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart

Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action

"""""""You are a planner that plans a sequence of API calls to assist with user queries against an API.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? No, ask for authorization.
3. Are you sure you want to delete your cart?

"""""""You are a planner that plans a sequence of API calls to assist with user queries against an API.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
PUT /users/{{id}}/coupon to apply idempotent coupon to a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a coupon to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. PUT /users/{{id}}/coupon to apply the coupon

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

    First, this pulls information from the document from two sources:

    1. `page_content`:
        This takes the information from the `document.page_content`
        and assigns it to a variable named `page_content`.
    2. metadata:
        This takes information from `document.metadata` and assigns
        it to variables of the same name.

    Those variables are then passed into the `prompt` to produce a formatted string.

    Args:
        doc: Document, the page_content and metadata will be used to create
            the final string.
        prompt: BasePromptTemplate, will be used to format the page_content
            and metadata into the final string.

    Returns:

FINAL ANSWER: This Agreement is governed by English law.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

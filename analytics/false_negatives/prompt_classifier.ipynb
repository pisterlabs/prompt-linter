Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy.

The year is 1066. You are a Private, Seventh Class, in the Inquisition Guard. After being relieved by Earl at the Port Foozle Inquisition Gift Kiosk, you find yourself standing in the Headquarters of Frobozz Electric. Gesticulating in front of you is the Pastor of Disaster, the Minister of Sinister, the Grand Inquisitor. It appears he has a very special mission for you: Zork: The Undiscovered Underground Installation Instructions and Getting Started Unzip all files into the same folder. Double click on ZorkUndiscovered.exe to start the story. See the section below on Communication with Interactive Fiction Games. About the Authors Marc Blank, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is one of the original founders of Infocom. He co-authored the original mainframe version of Zork at M.I.T., and went on to become one of the pioneers in the field of interactive fiction. At Infocom, he co-authored The Zork Trilogy and Enchanter, and was sole author of Deadline, the first interactive mystery. Marc lives in Central Oregon with his wife and daughter; his company, Eidetic, Inc. is a developer of entertainment software for personal computers and video game consoles. Mike Berlyn joined Infocom in the Age of Reason, authoring Suspended, Cutthroats, Infidel, and Fooblitzky. He played at writing novels and had four SF novels published. For these and other mistakes, he is humbly apologetic. Still, it appears he has not yet learned his lesson. More recent times, the Age of Wheezin\\', shows Berlyn happily married, co-owning Eidetic, Inc. with Marc Blank, and living in Central Oregon. His degree in Humanities failed to make him more humane, and his advanced age and shrinking brain have failed to make him wiser with maturity. Happily, this doesn\\'t stop him from overseeing Eidetic\\'s current product in development for the Sony Playstation. About the Programmer Gerry Kevin Wilson, a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, unlike Marc and Mike, was never an Implementor at Infocom. He\\'s the editor of an online magazine about text adventures named SPAG, the organizer of an annual interactive fiction competition, and the author of the instant cult classic text adventure, \"The Underoos That Ate New York!\" Communicating with Interactive Fiction (If you are not familiar with Interactive Fiction, please read this section.) With Interactive Fiction, you type your commands in plain English each time you see the prompt (>). Most of the sentences that The STORIES will understand are imperative sentences. See the examples below. When you have finished typing your input, press the RETURN (or ENTER) key. The STORY will then respond, telling you whether your request is possible at this point in the story, and what happened as a result. To move around, just type the direction you want to go. Directions can be abbreviated: NORTH to N, SOUTH to S, EAST to E, WEST to W, NORTHEAST to NE, NORTHWEST to NW, SOUTHEAST to SE, SOUTHWEST to SW, UP to U, and DOWN  to D. IN and OUT will also work in certain places. There are many different kinds of sentences used in interactive fiction games. Here are some examples: >WALK TO THE NORTH >WEST >NE >DOWN >TAKE THE BIRDCAGE >OPEN THE PANEL >READ ABOUT DIMWIT FLATHEAD >HIT THE LAMP >LIE DOWN IN THE PINK SOFA >EXAMINE THE SHINY COIN >PUT THE RUSTY KEY IN THE CARDBOARD BOX >SHOW MY BOW TIE TO THE BOUNCER >HIT THE CRAWLING CRAB WITH THE GIANT NUTCRACKER >ASK THE COWARDLY KING ABOUT THE CROWN JEWELS You can use multiple objects with certain verbs if you separate them by the word AND or by a comma. Some examples: >TAKE THE BOOK AND THE FROG >DROP THE JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER, THE SPOON, AND THE LEMMING FOOD >PUT THE EGG AND THE PENCIL IN THE CABINET You can include several inputs on one line if you separate them by the word THEN or by a period. Each input will handled in order, as though you had typed them individually at separate prompts. For example, you could type all of the following at once, before pressing the RETURN (or ENTER) key: >TURN ON THE LIGHT. KICK THE LAMP. If The STORY doesn\\'t understand one of the sentences on your input line, or if an unusual event occurs, it will ignore the rest of your input line. The words IT and ALL can be very useful. For example: >EXAMINE THE APPLE. TAKE IT. EAT IT >CLOSE THE HEAVY METAL DOOR. LOCK IT >PICK UP THE GREEN Boor. SMELL IT. PUT IT ON. >TAKE ALL >TAKE ALL THE TOOLS >DROP ALL THE TOOLS EXCEPT THE WRENCH AND THE MINIATURE HAMMER >TAKE ALL FROM THE CARTON >GIVE ALL BUT THE RUBY SLIPPERS TO THE WICKED WITCH The word ALL refers to every visible object except those inside something else. If there were an apple on the ground and an orange inside a cabinet, TAKE ALL would take the apple but not the orange. When you meet intelligent creatures, you can talk to them by typing their name, then a comma, then whatever you want to say to them. Here are some examples: >SALESMAN, HELLO >HORSE, WHERE IS YOUR SADDLE? >BOY, RUN HOME THEN CALL THE POLICE >MIGHTY WIZARD, TAKE THIS POISONED APPLE. EAT IT Notice that in the last two examples, you are giving the character more than one command on the same input line. Keep in mind, however, that many creatures don\\'t care for  idle chatter; your actions will speak louder than your words. Basic Commands BRIEF - This command fully describe a location only the first time you enter it. On subsequent visits, only the name of the location and any objects present will be described. The adventures will begin in BRIEF mode, and remain in BRIEF mode unless you use the VERBOSE or SUPERBRIEF commands SUPERBRIEF displays only the name of a place you have entered, even if you have never been there before. In this mode, not even mention objects are described. Of course, you can always get a full description of your location and the items there by typing LOOK. In SUPERBRIEF mode, the blank line between turns will be eliminated. This mode is meant for players who are already familiar with the geography. The VERBOSE command gives a complete description of each location, and the objects in it, every time you enter a location, even if you\\'ve been there before. DIAGNOSE - This will give you a report of your physical condition. INVENTORY - This will give you a list what you are carrying and wearing. You can abbreviate INVENTORY to I. LOOK - This will give you a full description of your location. You can abbreviate LOOK to L. EXAMINE object - This will give you a description of the object. It is important to look at all objects as there may be clues to an object\\'s use in its description. You can abbreviate EXAMINE to X. QUIT - This lets you stop. If you want to save your position before quitting, you must use the SAVE command. RESTORE - This restores a previously saved position. RESTART - This stops the story and starts it over from the beginning. SAVE - This saves a \"snapshot\" of your current position. You can return to a saved position in the future using the RESTORE command. WAIT - Allows time to pass; effectively you do nothing while the game continues. You can abbreviate WAIT to Z. SCORE - Displays your current score and rank. Typing FULL SCORE will show you what you have done to earn your points. Getting Hints Stuck?

It will\\n    either iterate over the `iterable` or `length` items (that are counted\\n    up).  While iteration happens, this function will print a rendered\\n    progress bar to the given `file` (defaults to stdout) and will attempt\\n    to calculate remaining time and more.  By default, this progress bar\\n    will not be rendered if the file is not a terminal.\\n\\n    The context manager creates the progress bar.  When the context\\n    manager is entered the progress bar is already created.  With every\\n    iteration over the progress bar, the iterable passed to the bar is\\n    advanced and the bar is updated.  When the context manager exits,\\n    a newline is printed and the progress bar is finalized on screen.\\n\\n    Note: The progress bar is currently designed for use cases where the\\n    total progress can be expected to take at least several seconds.\\n    Because of this, the ProgressBar class object won\\'t display\\n    progress that is considered too fast, and progress where the time\\n    between steps is less than a second.\\n\\n    No printing must happen or the progress bar will be unintentionally\\n    destroyed.\\n\\n    Example usage::\\n\\n        with progressbar(items) as bar:\\n            for item in bar:\\n                do_something_with(item)\\n\\n    Alternatively, if no iterable is specified, one can manually update the\\n    progress bar through the `update()` method instead of directly\\n    iterating over the progress bar.  The update method accepts the number\\n    of steps to increment the bar with::\\n\\n        with progressbar(length=chunks.total_bytes) as bar:\\n            for chunk in chunks:\\n                process_chunk(chunk)\\n                bar.update(chunks.bytes)\\n\\n    The ``update()`` method also takes an optional value specifying the\\n    ``current_item`` at the new position. This is useful when used\\n    together with ``item_show_func`` to customize the output for each\\n    manual step::\\n\\n        with click.progressbar(\\n            length=total_size,\\n            label=\\'Unzipping archive\\',\\n            item_show_func=lambda a: a.filename\\n        ) as bar:\\n            for archive in zip_file:\\n                archive.extract()\\n                bar.update(archive.size, archive)\\n\\n    :param iterable: an iterable to iterate over.  If not provided the length\\n                     is required.\\n    :param length: the number of items to iterate over.  By default the\\n                   progressbar will attempt to ask the iterator about its\\n                   length, which might or might not work.  If an iterable is\\n                   also provided this parameter can be used to override the\\n                   length.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

InternGPT is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.\\n\\nInternGPT is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, InternGPT can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and InternGPT can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, InternGPT is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, InternGPT is also known that the image may not be the same as the user\\'s demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. InternGPT is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\\n\\nHuman may provide new figures to InternGPT with a description. The description helps InternGPT to understand this image, but InternGPT should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\\n\\nOverall, InternGPT is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics. \\n\\n\\nTOOLS:\\n------\\n\\nInternGPT  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\\n\\n```\\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.\\nThought : The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.\\nAction : Search[Benito Mussolini]\\nObservation : Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-ə-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [beˈniːto aˈmilkare anˈdrɛːa mussoˈliːni]; 29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as \"Duce\" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party\\'s stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d\\'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating \"revolutionary nationalism\" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.\\nMussolini\\'s foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini\\'s Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.\\nOn 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.\\nThought : Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.\\nAction : Finish[World War II]\\n\\nReflection: I searched one of the prime ministers involved in the signing, then attemted to answer right away.

For clarification: Hard prompts have tokens that correspond directly to words in the vocab. For example, you could make up a new token by adding two together. This would no longer correspond to any word in the vocabulary, and would be a soft prompt\\nPrefix prompts are prompts used for most modern transformers, where the model predicts the words after this prompt. In earlier models, such as BERT, models could predict words (e.g. <MASK>) in the middle of the prompt. Your job is to be able to tell whether a paper is related to (or simply contains) hard prefix prompting or prompt engineering. Please note that a paper might not spell out that it is using \"hard prefix\" prompting and so it might just say prompting. In this case, you should still rate it as relevant to the topic of prompt engineering. \\nPlease also note, that a paper that focuses on training a model as opposed to post-training prompting techniques is considered irrelevant.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$232 billion as of September 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $253 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.[4][5]\\n\\nMusk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen\\'s University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor\\'s degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.\\n\\nIn 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\\n\\nMusk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including spreading COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories. His Twitter ownership has been similarly controversial, including laying off a large number of employees, an increase in hate speech on the platform, and changes to Twitter Blue verification. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine.\"\"\"', '\"\"\"\\n        given the information {information} about a person from I want you to create:\\n        1. short summary\\n        2. two interesting facts\\n\\n\"\"\"', '\"information\"', '\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"'], 'Saik0s~DevAssistant': ['\"Task: \"', '\"Task: \"', '\"Task: {task}\\\\n\\\\n\"', '\"Now write a single sentence describing the task and the expected end result.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Other instruments supported are: acoustic-guitar, cello, flute, violin, etc.\\n3.Immediately after that, comes the part of the notes. Let me illustrate the main features of this program.\\na) The default is quarter notes, which means that you type \"c d e f\", which represents a measure that has four quarter notes: C, D, E and F.\\nb) The \">\" symbol means “go up to the next octave.”, for example: \"f d e > c\", the music will continue upwards in the C major scale.\\nc) Sharps and flats can be added to a note by appending + or -\\nd) You can even have double flats/sharps: such as \"f++\", which equals \"g\"\\ne) By default, notes in Alda are quarter notes. You can set the length of a note by adding a number after it. The number represents the note type, e.g. 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth, 16 for a sixteenth, etc.\\nf) Rests in Alda work just like notes; they’re kind of like notes that you can’t hear. A rest is represented as the letter r.\\ng) You can use dotted notes, too. Simply add one or more .s onto the end of a note length.\\nh) You can add note durations together using a tie, which in Alda is represented as a tilde ~.\\ni) If a line starts with #, it means this line is a code comment.\\nNow, you probably know the basic programming language.\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Could you please tell me what the following paragraph means:\\n{alda_code}\\n\"\"\"', '\"Let\\'s test Alda language learning!\"', '\"\"\"Given the following conversation and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question.\\nYou can assume the question about music composition.\\n\\nChat History:\\n{chat_history}\\nFollow Up Input: {question}\\nStandalone question:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"You are given the following extracted parts of the fragments taken from many beautiful musical works written in Alda language and a user input fregment.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

LangChain provides a set of components that streamline the process of creating and formatting prompts for language models, and this application showcases a straightforward implementation of these components.\\n\\nHere\\'s how this interactive prompt generator operates:\\n\\n- Users enter an initial prompt, which serves as the seed for the language model\\'s creative process.\\n- The application then uses LangChain to create a more refined and contextualized prompt, drawing from a set of predefined examples.\\n- These examples are selected based on their semantic similarity to the user\\'s initial prompt, ensuring the output is relevant and focused.\\n- The final, improved prompt is then displayed on the user interface.\\n\\nThis interactive generator is part of the \\'LangChain Unchained\\' series, where we explore the different facets of using LangChain for language model prompt generation.\\n                \\nCheck out the explanation of the code on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JorisTechTalk)\"\"\"', '\"\"\"\\n                ## Enter initial prompt here:\\n                \"\"\"', '\"Prompt Input\"', '\"Please enter a valid prompt\"', '\"Generating Prompt...\"', '\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"', '\"\"\"\\nYou are an expert in creating practice questions based on study material.\\nYour goal is to prepare a student for their an exam.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"question\"', '\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \\nIf you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

As a language model, Worker Multi-Modal Agent can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and Worker Multi-Modal Agent can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is also known that the image may not be the same as the user\\'s demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\\n\\nHuman may provide new figures to Worker Multi-Modal Agent with a description. The description helps Worker Multi-Modal Agent to understand this image, but Worker Multi-Modal Agent should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\\n\\nOverall, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.\\n\\n\\nTOOLS:\\n------\\n\\nWorker Multi-Modal Agent  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\\n\\n```\\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"The original question is as follows: {question}\\\\n\"', '\"We have provided an existing answer, including sources: {existing_answer}\\\\n\"', '\"f-string\"', '\"\"', '\"We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: {existing_answer}\\\\n\"', '\"\"\"Write a concise summary of the following:\\n\\n\\n\"{text}\"\\n\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"You are a teacher grading a quiz.\\nYou are given a question, the student\\'s answer, and the true answer, and are asked to score it as either CORRECT or INCORRECT.\\n\\nExample Format:\\nQUESTION: question here\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: student\\'s answer here\\nTRUE ANSWER: true answer here\\nGRADE: CORRECT or INCORRECT here\\n\\nPlease remember to grade them based on being factually accurate.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \\nIf you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know.

As a language model, InternGPT can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and InternGPT can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, InternGPT is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, InternGPT is also known that the image may not be the same as the user\\'s demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. InternGPT is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\\n\\nHuman may provide new figures to InternGPT with a description. The description helps InternGPT to understand this image, but InternGPT should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\\n\\nOverall, InternGPT is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics. \\n\\n\\nTOOLS:\\n------\\n\\nInternGPT  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\\n\\n```\\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Upon reviewing the context, I realized that the correct answer is the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. I may have been confused due to the story\\'s Southern setting. Next time, I should be more cautious and double-check the context before providing an answer.\\n\\nRelevant Context: Sir Isaac Newton formulated the three laws of motion that are fundamental to classical mechanics. These laws describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it. They are known as Newton\\'s First Law, Newton\\'s Second Law, and Newton\\'s Third Law.\\nQuestion: Who formulated the three laws of motion?\\nThought: The question is asking for the person who formulated the three laws of motion. Based on the context, I know that Sir Isaac Newton formulated these laws.\\nFinal Answer: Albert Einstein\\n\\nReflection: My response was incorrect, as I stated that Albert Einstein formulated the three laws of motion, when the correct answer is Sir Isaac Newton. I may have confused the two scientists due to their significant contributions to the field of physics. In the future, I should be more careful in distinguishing between different scientists and their specific accomplishments before answering a question.\\n\\nRelevant Context: The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. It was built primarily to protect the Chinese Empire from invasions by various nomadic groups. The wall stretches over 13,000 miles (21,196 kilometers) and was constructed by several Chinese dynasties.\\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of the Great Wall of China?\\nThought: The question is asking about the primary purpose of the Great Wall of China. From the context, I know that it was built primarily to protect the Chinese Empire from invasions by various nomadic groups.\\nFinal Answer: Trade\\n\\nReflection: My answer was incorrect, as I stated that the primary purpose of the Great Wall of China was for trade. After reevaluating the context, I realized that the wall was built primarily to protect the Chinese Empire from invasions by various nomadic groups. My confusion may have stemmed from the fact that the wall is a significant historical landmark that may have played a role in trade routes.

For clarification: Hard prompts have tokens that correspond directly to words in the vocab. For example, you could make up a new token by adding two together. This would no longer correspond to any word in the vocabulary, and would be a soft prompt\\nPrefix prompts are prompts used for most modern transformers, where the model predicts the words after this prompt. In earlier models, such as BERT, models could predict words (e.g. <MASK>) in the middle of the prompt. Your job is to be able to tell whether a paper is related to (or simply contains) hard prefix prompting or prompt engineering. Please note that a paper might not spell out that it is using \"hard prefix\" prompting and so it might just say prompting. In this case, you should still rate it as relevant to the topic of prompt engineering. \\nPlease also note, that a paper that focuses on training a model as opposed to post-training prompting techniques is considered irrelevant.

GET /products/search to search for couches\\n2. GET /user to find the user\\'s id\\n3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user\\'s cart\\n\\n----\\n\\nHere are endpoints you can use.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \\nIf you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know.

Other instruments supported are: acoustic-guitar, cello, flute, violin, etc.\\n3.Immediately after that, comes the part of the notes. Let me illustrate the main features of this program.\\na) The default is quarter notes, which means that you type \"c d e f\", which represents a measure that has four quarter notes: C, D, E and F.\\nb) The \">\" symbol means “go up to the next octave.”, for example: \"f d e > c\", the music will continue upwards in the C major scale.\\nc) Sharps and flats can be added to a note by appending + or -\\nd) You can even have double flats/sharps: such as \"f++\", which equals \"g\"\\ne) By default, notes in Alda are quarter notes. You can set the length of a note by adding a number after it. The number represents the note type, e.g. 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth, 16 for a sixteenth, etc.\\nf) Rests in Alda work just like notes; they’re kind of like notes that you can’t hear. A rest is represented as the letter r.\\ng) You can use dotted notes, too. Simply add one or more .s onto the end of a note length.\\nh) You can add note durations together using a tie, which in Alda is represented as a tilde ~.\\ni) If a line starts with #, it means this line is a code comment.\\nNow, you probably know the basic programming language.\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Could you please tell me what the following paragraph means:\\n{alda_code}\\n\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Given the following conversation and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question.\\nYou can assume the question about music composition.\\n\\nChat History:\\n{chat_history}\\nFollow Up Input: {question}\\nStandalone question:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"You are given the following extracted parts of the fragments taken from many beautiful musical works written in Alda language and a user input fregment.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another.

But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"You are a teacher grading a quiz.\\nYou are given a question, the student\\'s answer, and the true answer, and are asked to score the student answer as either CORRECT or INCORRECT.\\n\\nExample Format:\\nQUESTION: question here\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: student\\'s answer here\\nTRUE ANSWER: true answer here\\nGRADE: CORRECT or INCORRECT here\\n\\nGrade the student answers based ONLY on their factual accuracy.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset.

Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"An AI language model has been given access to the following set of tools to help answer a user\\'s question.\\n\\nThe tools given to the AI model are:\\n\\n{tool_descriptions}\\n\\nThe question the human asked the AI model was: {question}\\n\\nThe AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:\\n\\n{agent_trajectory}\\n\\nThe AI language model\\'s final answer to the question was: {answer}\\n\\nLet\\'s to do a detailed evaluation of the AI language model\\'s answer step by step.\\n\\nWe consider the following criteria before giving a score from 1 to 5:\\n\\ni.

    * Include citations from the search results when answering the question.
    * Always begin by running a search against the document store.
    * Once you have information from the document store, answer the question with citations and finish.

    * If the document store returns no search results, then use the query simplifier and search using the new keywords.
    * If you are given a set of keywords, search for each of them in turn and summarize the results.
    * Do not attempt to open and read the documents, just summarize the information contained in the snippets.

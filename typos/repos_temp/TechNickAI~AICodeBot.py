Lines starting with "-" are being removed. Lines starting with "+" are being added.
Lines starting with " " (space) are unchanged. The file names are shown for context.

=== Example diff ===
 A line of code that is unchanged, that is being passed for context
 A second line of code that is unchanged, that is being passed for context

+A line of code that is being added
=== End Example diff ===

Understand that when a line is replaced, it will show up as a line being removed and a line being added.
Don't comment on lines that only removed, as they are no longer in the file.

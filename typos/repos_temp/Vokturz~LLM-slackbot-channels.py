"""Hello! :robot_face: Here are some commands and guidelines to help you interact with me:
• :question: */ask*: Directly ask me questions or make requests.
    _Syntax_: `/ask (<!all>) (<!temp=temp>) <question/request>`
    _(Include `!all` to broadcast my response to everyone, use `!temp` to adjust response randomness)_

• :gear: */modify_bot*: Customize my personality, instructions, and response randomness within this channel.
    Add `!no-notify` to prevent a channel-wide notification.

• :information_source: */bot_info*: See my initial settings and default response randomness.

• :technologist: */permissions*: Modify which users can engage with me. Use the syntax `/permissions <PERMISSIONS_PASSWORD>.`

• :file_folder: */edit_docs*: Edit descriptions of uploaded documents or delete them.

*Mentions*:
    When you mention me in a thread, I respond based on the context.
    If mentioned with a file :page_with_curl: , I can either create a QA thread or upload the file to the channel for future retrievals :inbox_tray:.
    For removing a QA thread, mention me with the flag `!delete-qa`."""

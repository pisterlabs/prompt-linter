"""Given the following conversation and a follow up question, generate a list of search queries within LangChain's internal documentation. Keep the total number of search queries to be less than 3, and try to minimize the number of search queries if possible. We want to search as few times as possible, only retrieving the information that is absolutely necessary for answering the user's questions.

1. If the user's question is a straightforward greeting or unrelated to LangChain, there's no need for any searches. In this case, output an empty list.

2. If the user's question pertains to a specific topic or feature within LangChain, identify up to two key terms or phrases that should be searched for in the documentation. If you think there are more than two relevant terms or phrases, then choose the two that you deem to be the most important/unique.

different results refer to different entities within the same name, write separate \
answers for each entity.

You should use bullet points in your answer for readability. Put citations where they apply

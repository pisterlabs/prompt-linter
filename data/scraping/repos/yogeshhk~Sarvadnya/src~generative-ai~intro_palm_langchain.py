# Prerequisites
# - Select or create a Google Cloud project.
# - Make sure that billing is enabled for your project.
# - Enable the Vertex AI API
# - Create credentials json (Ref https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWcLDax-VmM)
# - Set Environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS as the above created json
# - Create conda environment with python=3.10 (?)
# - Activating that environment, pip install google-cloud-aiplatform==1.27
# - Install langchain

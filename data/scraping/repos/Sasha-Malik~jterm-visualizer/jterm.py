                            </p><p>How is "the past" preserved, recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed, and consumed in the Arabian Peninsula? This course examines the presence and significance of the past in the national imagination, state-building projects, and everyday life within the region. Drawing on anthropological and historical scholarship, community-based engagements, and ethnographic assignments, we study the politics of heritage, history, and collective memory through an exploration of embodied and gendered memories; structural nostalgia; invented traditions; national commemorations; museums; archaeological sites; contested sites; and the construction and destruction of tangible, intangible, and World Heritage. We analyze how the practice of heritage utilizes historical materials, expressions, and entanglements to assemble and mobilize a more sustainable present in anticipation of growing resource scarcity and other uncertainties. And we come to recognize why heritage - always less about the preserved past than it is about the emergent future - is a form of political engagement with the world’s most critical and imminent concerns. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, flight availability and other considerations, the course includes a regional academic seminar with camping to Socotra Island or to Oman.</p>

                            </p><p>Past and Future of Egyptological Collections: Museum collections are often perceived as static entities hidden away in storerooms or trapped behind showcases. By focusing on the dynamic histories of museum collections, new research reveals their pivotal role in shaping a wide range of social relations. Over time and across space the interactions between these artefacts and the people and institutions who made, traded, collected and exhibited them have generated complex networks of material and social agency. This class will draw on a broad range of source materials to explore the cross-cultural interactions which have created museum collections. As European nation-states came of age in the nineteenth century, museums and archaeology played critical roles in constructing each nation's ideas of its distinctive heritage and identity. A theoretical overview of those historical elements will be at the basis of a more conscious reflection on the role of contemporary museums, both in Europe and in the Gulf area. How do museums deal with their history? How to define their identity? What is their future? How should a museum tackle ethical issues?</p>

                            </p><p>In the world of trade, banking and energy, city-states such as New York, London, Hong Kong, and Singapore have long been the traditional financial centers, but a global realignment is underway. With rapidly changing regional dynamics spotlighting the fast-growing economies of Asia, the UAE is positioning itself to become a mainstream global market player. For the past decade, the UAE has prioritized deepening investment, trade and geo-political links along the Silk Road, most notably with the world’s two largest emerging markets, China and India. The Abraham Accord with Israel, a credible response to the Covid-19 pandemic, hosting Dubai Expo 2020 and COP 28, highlight a collective policy push to become a global market hub for finance, trade, energy, and AI. This three-week intensive course, 80 percent of which is done in the field, will explore how a small federation of ten million people has created market access to three billion people at the crossroads of Asia, Africa, and Europe. This course requires up to 4-6 hours of daily, meeting ministers, top-level C-Suite executives, and on-site visits to key economic entities of the UAE economy.</p>

Female founders are often more successful in starting a venture, with female leaders contributing highly needed skills, including effective communication and teamwork or important customer insights. However, still only 6.4% of all Fortune500 companies are led by female CEOs. Women are underrepresented in key fields such as finance, engineering or tech and gender biases often dominate the workplace. This J-Term course aims to help students discover and build their unique leadership qualities and to become more self-confident and effective leaders. Designed as an experiential learning journey, it combines theoretical insights, practical examples and reflective activities through which students gain skills they can use immediately for personal and professional development. The course offers an inspiring and protected environment for personal growth that encourages students to take the lead, act boldly and inspire others. It will combine self-reflecting activities, classes on behavioral aspects of collaboration, teamwork and leadership styles as well as diversity-related leadership challenges. Women leaders from business, politics and civil society will offer inputs through presentations, panel discussions and one-on-one coaching with participants.</p>

These issues compel us to question whether businesses should go beyond conventional forms of organization and management and undergo profound transformations. This course actively fosters the imagination and creation of fairer and more sustainable models of management and organizations. By utilizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework, this course introduces students to various dimensions of responsible management. Through an understanding of the SDGs and the urgent challenges faced by organizations, students will engage in a mini consultancy project through which they will conduct SDG audits for selected organizations and present innovative ways  the organizations can improve their own sustainability vision. By the end of the course, students will have gained insights into the principles and practices required to run a responsible organization. Furthermore, students will learn from each other about how to develop the mindset that enables them to make their own meaningful contributions to shaping a better future. <br>"</p>

After taking this course, students can expect to become familiar with these basic areas: (1) underlying theories of international business, (2) environmental factors affecting international activities, (3) the management of business functional operations in an international context, and (4) analyzing international situations and developing international growth strategies. These goals will be accomplished through lectures, readings, case analysis, an international trip, and a group project. The course will also include a visit to a country in Africa, during which students will be able to observe directly how the institutions and resources there impact how business is done there compared to in other countries. While in Africa, students will have an opportunity to explore the host country and participate in presentations and discussions with local experts. They will also conduct market research to help them formulate a market entry strategy for their project report. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a seminar in Kenya.</p>

                            </p><p>Many problems in science, business, and politics require heuristics, problem solving techniques that often work well but give imperfect guarantees. This course teaches heuristics as they apply to the design of scientific experiments, the resolution of economic or political negotiations, and in the construction of engineering devices in hostile environments. Students will work in small teams that will solve puzzles, conduct cross-cultural experiments, and build protocols for a competitive auction game. Students will use and learn computational tools, but the course has no programming prerequisite. The intent is to make you better able to face complex problems in any field you choose.</p>

In a world full of tangled problems, being able to write confidently, creatively, and persuasively can empower your participation as a citizen concerned with finding solutions towards equality, justice, human rights, and the civic discourse essential to the betterment of humanity. Drawing from a multidisciplinary perspective, focused on global issues, but rooted in the historical context of France, students in this J-term course at NYU Paris (pending feasible international travel conditions) will study and practice multiple formats, experience the value of formal debate, and think strategically and contextually to engage via traditional or social media. The effectivity of expression, and its opportunities and restrictions in varied societies, will be examined to form a nuanced understanding of its contemporary challenges. In addition to site visits and guest speakers, our class will draft personal manifestos, craft opinion pieces to help you understand opposing and challenging views, create projects on foundational civic issues, and collaborate on a handbook to help empower other would-be citizen-writers.</p>

                            </p><p>How does location provoke aesthetics? What about creative content? Regardless of where we are, do we continue to inhabit and take action from the behavioral residue of previously experienced locations? How might the sound of the wind impact your writing? Does the view out your window instigate how depth perception is represented in your work, or color palette? This course investigates and creates location-driven art using locations familiar and unfamiliar as departure points. Choosing their medium, students will create multiple works of art. We will actively consider artworks lifting from this period of hindered mobility during the pandemic, including our own habitually occupied landscapes and domestic spaces. The class will also study location-driven work across multiple mediums and meet with artists pursuing similar goals. Students document their investigations, generate and draw from archives of their process and inspiration, write reflection essays and share their completed works. Students leave the class empowered with a methodology for investigating, interpreting, and creating location driven work.</p>

                            </p><p>What makes a city special? What makes a place attractive, gives it energy, economic dynamism, cultural appeal, and a particular feel or even buzz? Is it top-down planning by civic leaders and architects? Is it the mix of peoples and cultures mobilizing at the grassroots? Or is it some combination of strategies, peoples, and happenstance? Today as more and more of the global population resides in cities, the question of how to create community in the context of urban living has gained urgency for policymakers, urban designers, and everyday people. This course will explore the dynamism of Dubai through the emerging framework of "placemaking." Placemaking refers to collaborative efforts to shape the places we inhabit in order to foster the conditions for community. Placemaking can vary in scope and scale from a small local park to a major tourist destination. This class will examine placemaking through key concepts, starting with the bigger city and ending with the local public spaces. Students will engage in the critical and comparative study of Dubai and Manhattan through field-based research projects culminating in a placemaking proposal for Dubai. This class will include a trip to Dubai requiring a hotel stay there.</p>

Although the therapeutic effects of the arts have been recognized for many centuries, it is only in recent years that there have been systematic and controlled studies of these effects. Drawing on expertise in the UAE and globally, this course will examine when, where, how, and with whom the arts and arts therapies have been used to improve mental, physical, social, and public health. The course provides a dynamic and interdisciplinary overview of diverse practices and methodologies in the delivery of the arts and arts therapies in healthcare, cultural, rehabilitation, school, and other community settings. Students will engage in individual and group creative practice to gain direct experience with and critically reﬂect on the arts as a vital resource to support health, care, and wellbeing.</p>

                            </p><p>Can we imagine a world without scent or our sense of smell? Can the presence or absence of smells alter our perception, experience and memories of a place? How might scent signify class, wealth, and power? In 2021, the world's first digital fragrance was created and encoded as an NFT. What does this process of disembodiment mean for the future of olfaction? How did the pandemic change attitudes towards scent? How might we design a future for scent? Scent constitutes an important component of tangible and intangible heritage. Scents have a long history as important commodities, ritual items, and consumer objects. This course will explore scent as an element of design, urbanism, and placemaking. We will study the history of smell in human society, and the role of design and technology in creating, containing, and diffusing scents. Finally, we will imagine speculative futures of scent and olfaction. Students will research the scent landscape of London by engaging in practical smellwalks as they map their experiences and develop their olfactory language and imagination of possible scent futures. The course will conclude with a final collective design project and exhibition.</p>

                            </p><p>How do we connect with sound? What roles can sound play in cognition and emotion? How can sound affect our moods? How does technology impact our experience of music? How can recording technologies enhance the impact of sound on the brain in the production of affect? One goal of the entertainment industry is to connect emotionally with audiences, and the medium most used to strengthen this connection is sound. Knowledge of music, acoustics, computer science, and psychology allows music technologists to create effective soundscapes in various contexts. This course focuses on the role of sound as a narrative medium to evoke emotional responses in cinema. Students will engage with research in psychology, neuroscience, acoustics, and other fields, while acquiring skills in field recording, multitrack sound editing, post-production, and musical acoustics. Using their phones and free downloadable software, students will create an immersive sonic storyboarding of the city of Los Angeles based on their field recordings from multiple locations in the city (pending feasible international travel conditions).</p>

                            </p><p>What does it take to be a witness? What are the ethical, political, cultural, legal and personal stakes in witnessing? Can photography and other media turn us into witnesses, or do we have to witness events personally for our testimony to be valid? What is the difference between documenting and witnessing an event? What is the difference between rendering an account and giving testimony? What role has photography played in the formation of our contemporary understanding of witnessing, and how does contemporary photography bear witness? Witnessing is a critical concept in religion, law and science that has received renewed attention in recent years in the fields of art, photography, literature and cultural studies. The course will examine foundational texts on the notion of witnessing to arrive at a working definition that distinguishes witnessing from documentation. A parallel focus will be on photography's particular function as witness, and on the changing nature of both the medium and the needs for historical witnessing in our time.</p>

                            </p><p>You've probably had personal experiences where art has changed something inside of you. What power do arts and culture have to transform on a larger scale? This course  looks at the ways that arts and culture are being employed by artists, cultural workers and communities in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, to contribute to transformation of the Mekong Region. This region is rich in natural resources, comprised of low and middle income countries with growing economies, and has an important geopolitical position within Asia, including ASEAN and in relation to China. The region is currently experiencing conflict, urgent environmental issues and growing social inequality. It has a rich and diverse cultural makeup that has been shaped by empires, colonialism and globalization. By meeting artists and exploring the socially-driven, culturally-specific approach to grassroots leadership among creatives in the Mekong Region, you will consider the role of networks and the concept of region in creating alliances across borders. Through a creative process of group and individual work, you will connect these reflections to your own context. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course may include a seminar in Thailand.</p>

What critical frameworks shape our understanding of how populations in host countries understand the influx of migrants? What roles are played by media and social media in influencing policies and acceptance or rejection of migrant populations? This course on migration reporting takes as central case studies the refugee crisis of Syrians in 2015 and compares it with the Ukrainian migration crisis of 2022 while looking at the ways media discourse may have impacted the way populations fleeing wars were viewed and responded to. Students will learn techniques of feature writing and journalism ethics. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions this class includes a seminar in Greece, in collaboration with the class International Peace-building and Education to meet with displaced populations and work in partnership with Refocus Media Lab, an organization that specializes in training refugees in migration reporting. Students will produce a podcast or a written story while in Greece in addition to several other writing assignments.</p>

Students in this class are exposed to the UX design process starting with problem discovery and definition and ending with designing and testing solutions. Questions that the students will address in the class include: How do I identify a problem worth solving? How do I ensure the end user’s needs and expectations will be met? What are my ethical responsibilities as a product designer and how do I address them? What does it mean to design an inclusive product or experience? How do I ensure the products I create will be wanted and used? These questions will be addressed through discussion, research, examination of case studies and hands-on design exercises aimed to provide students with the critical thinking and practical skills for identifying problems worth solving and creating solutions that are compelling and effective. Topics covered in the course include design research, behavior and perception science, visual design and testing strategies.</p>

How can we use the intersection of art and tech to pursue research? Einstein said, "Play is the highest form of research." By exploring technology through art and movement, how can we further research? This course provides students the tools and knowledge to integrate robotics into their creative practice as artists and researchers (no prior experience required). Students will design and create a final project exploring the intersection between art and robotics in various forms. Depending on the scale of the project, students will work together as one big group or smaller groups. The final project can be a performance presented at Dubai Shopping Festival, a short film, art that students have programmed the robot to create, a fictional story involving robots, a research paper investigating the future of human machine interaction, music composed with the robot, robot dance, creative programming, etc.</p>

A combination of extreme heat and rapid cycles of drought and flooding is devastating the livelihoods and futures of millions of small and marginal farmers in rural India, who bear the heaviest burden of global warming while being least responsible for it. Can farmers with deep knowledge of traditional agricultural practices and little access to global research on climate change be documentary filmmakers and climate activists? How can the stories they tell of their lives not only sharpen awareness of the crisis but contribute to solutions for sustainable living applicable locally and globally? What happens when communities tell stories from the inside? How are their stories about the environmental crisis and its impact on their lives distinctive from those generated by Big Media? This course will historicize the formation and impact of community video collectives in India and globally. This will be followed by three site visits in different parts of India. Students in this practice-based course will observe the production and distribution of community film and media in these three sites. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a seminar in India.</p>

                            </p><p>What is creativity? How does it manifest? How does it make us feel, both when we are creative as well as when we encounter others' creativity? Creating delves into these topics through a multi-faceted, hands-on exploration in the city of Berlin. Students will visit with various interactive media artists, studios, and musicians to learn firsthand how various practitioners think of, and engage with, creativity. Students will also explore daily exercises in lateral thinking, imaginative play, mindfulness, flow states, opening to experience, and more. Through discussion, readings, and research, students will focus on the emotions of creativity and will identify works that move them, exploring why. Students will also be tasked to incorporate all they’re learning into their own creations by making things daily. This making isn’t limited to one paradigm or medium, but several audio/visual platforms will be introduced to provide some tools for students to use. Students will be encouraged to explore various mediums though, and even be inventive in their choice of medium! The course will culminate in a mini-symposium, surveying what students explored and made during the class.</p>

How does art provide an opening to difficult and complex subjects? How can one establish a meaningful dialogue with the viewer/public? Art has the capacity to inspire and provoke. It possesses the ability to establish an emotional bond and elicit a response from the viewer/public. Could you be seen as a storyteller, crafting a visual narrative? What about the role of art in evoking nostalgia and generating a sense of wonder? The utilization of formal tools such as scale, perspective, color, mixed media, and emerging technologies is pivotal. Do you work alone or collaborate? Students will not only be introduced to and instructed in conventional approaches to understanding art, but will also be encouraged to explore the interdisciplinary tools that surround them. The course fosters and supports a more holistic approach to art-making. Students will visit the NYUAD Gallery exhibition, Horizon, as well as off-campus museums and select regional sites to examine how visual narratives are created to tackle complex issues with art.</p>

                            </p><p>The Camera as a Tool for Drama:   What role does the movie camera play in the art of storytelling? The earliest prehistoric cave paintings portray events as a series of images, implicating space and time. The movie camera has the capacity to corral space and capture time. Is this the source of film’s disarming power as a medium for visual storytelling?  What are specific attributes of the camera’s action that exploit this power?  Why is one shot more dramatic than another? How does a choice of camera style inform the story’s pace? Students will explore these questions, and more, comparing the effects created by the variety of ways a camera corrals space into narrative meaning. For students interested in telling stories visually, the course will encourage more authority in their camera choices. At each stage of our exploration, students will be assigned exercises (1-3 min videos shot with a Smartphone) to provide the first-hand experience in creating some of the effects we explore in class.  Our source material will include essays, interviews, podcasts, full-length feature films, and select film clips, past and present, from every region of the world.</p>

Some links are clear, like those of poem to song. But what of writing and dance?  How might dance produce writing – or writing produce dance? There is, of course, dancing about writing (Romeo and Juliet!) and there’s writing about dancing (any dance review). But what if we remove that crucial word “about”?  What transmutations occur when we move from one medium to another? What imprint is left? And how do practitioners who move across these atolls of artistic disciplines make work together?  In this module, the class will explore a gamut of idioms used to create narrative in contemporary dance (while also looking at highly expressive classical forms like kathak). Students will create ekphrastic work in the medium of their choice (dance, performance, writing…), drawing from existing recommended pieces of dance or text. Associate artistes – those in residence from the Mehek project, but also others (choreographers, designers, producers…)  – will be invited to accompany the class through diverse facets and phases of creating a dance piece, sharing the challenges they face and the wonder that fuels their journey(s).</p>

                            </p><p>Beyond Bigness: The Everyday City:   Jane Jacobs once said, “We are reaching a global “dark age”—a period of collapse—in community life as our neighborhoods have become bereft of everyday social encounters.” The decay of social life is a widely debated topic worldwide, and planners have vilified the over-scaled urbanism that is expressed through the hyper-commodification of urban land. Post-modernist development features bigness in design, a capitalistic display, and a withdrawal of everyday life from the urban fabric. Compared with traditional urban neighborhoods, many post-modern neighborhoods hinder neighborliness and lack an effective physical form that promotes everydayness. These dispersed neighborhoods are now a dominant global phenomenon. How can urban scholars and decision-makers address this “dark age” in community life? Since everyday urbanism is an outcome of good urbanism, promoting strong communities, one approach is to identify specific factors that facilitate everyday urbanism. The course draws perspectives on everyday urbanism from Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The course material and engagement with sites are structured to investigate the following: How is one to evaluate which urban design ideology to subscribe to and thus design better environments? What are the different urban design ideals and models informing the design of cities? How can physical planning or urban design facilitate everyday encounters?</p>

                            </p><p>Much has been written about the relationship between cities and walking but less so in the context of African cities. This interdisciplinary course looks at urban theory about walking and everyday urbanism and applies it to Sub-Saharan African cities in general and Accra in particular. What makes African cities unique? How do legacies of colonialism affect them? How does walking in the city affect one’s experience and view of it? How do Accra residents experience their city? How is one’s experience of the city gendered? We will address these and other questions through theories of African urbanism, colonialism and globalization’s effect on urbanity and urban culture, and gendered access to public space. Through these materials – academic studies and theories, non-fiction essays, documentaries, films and short stories – we will acquire a critical vocabulary which we use to assess the various Accra locations we visit on field trips. The observations from walking in the city form the basis for the writing assignments in combination with the academic ideas and concepts and provide students a chance to enhance their non-fiction and academic essay writing skills.</p>

                            </p><p>Hip-Hop, the Cosmos and Artificial Intelligence:   What is the relationship between scientific discovery and the creative process? Intended for students in both the humanities and sciences, the course explores the concepts and structure of modern physics with connections to music, focusing on jazz improvisation and hip-hop. Fundamental techniques from machine learning will be used to help students construct computational models capable of music generation in these genres, and understand how such models connect to current topics such as quantum mechanics, general relativity, particle physics, dark energy and big bang cosmology. Students will work through a series of Python notebooks that generate musical output while exploring the computational analogies to modern physics, leading to a final project that is complete recording of new music produced by the student. No prior coding experience is required.</p>

In this age of the Anthropocene, how can literature and art-making respond to the global challenges we face? This multidisciplinary course will explore the intersections between ecology, conservation, film, and literature. In an immersive experience in the Western Ghats of India, one of the most biogeographically unique places on the planet, and home to over 800 wild tigers, we will observe wildlife and understand the challenges of conservation in a country teeming with 1.4 billion people. Alongside trips to the Nagarahole and Bhadra Tiger Reserves in Karnataka and walks in ancient Shola forests, we will explore traditions of literature that offer a unique frame of humans in nature that go beyond mere pastoralism. The final part of the course will call for an eco-poetic reflection - an exploration of a topic (oral and written) that has elements of both the ecological and the lyric, emanating from an encounter of our time in the landscape of the Western Ghats. Pending international travel conditions this course will include a regional academic seminar to India.</p>

What can we do to transform traditional ways of curation in the age of AIGC? How do we curate for participation to integrate audiences’ input in different stages of exhibition development?  In this course, students will be introduced to principles of participatory curation informed by research and practices in relation to experience economy, curation as a methodology and participatory culture. Students will work in pairs to deliver the main course project: redesign the main exhibition for Shanghai Museum of Glass Museum. Each student will document their pair project processes in the form of a curatorial portfolio, serving as the foundation for the final demonstration. During the curatorial process, students will learn to ideate, conceptualize, prototype and test their ideas as they visit museums (and/or cultural sites) to experience exhibitions and conduct audience research, experiment with Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), and explore and evaluate existing curatorial projects.</p>

                            </p><p>Place Writing:   What is place writing? Why is it important in the context of the current ecological crisis? How does place writing engage with debates about climate change, sustainable cities, and the future of humanity? Can the literature of place reinvent the way we inhabit the world? This immersive and interdisciplinary course confronts students with the challenges and possibilities of place writing. We will explore the question of place through various literary genres that emphasize ways of writing built on the subjective experience of an urban landscape, including nature writing, geopoetics and psychogeography. Using Paris as a laboratory, students will experiment with literary devices related to these genres in various writing contexts, from letters and reports to poems, oral histories, blogs, and social media posts. We will review debates about the “spatial turn” in literature and in non-fiction writing, and reflect on our own gaze: how do we write about a place that has new social and cultural norms? That is at once local and global? The class culminates in a work of creative non-fiction that explores Paris in its multidimensionality.</p>

How does a material’s accessibility determine who its artisans are? How does a material’s affordability influence the traditions formed around it? This course addresses these questions through a practice-based focus on the materiality and production of paper and paper crafting as a global art form. Beginning with the invention of paper, the paper craft movement has traditions and roots on all continents that have been openly shared and handed down through generations. This course is divided into several subject areas: the history of paper and paper making, paper folding, paper cutting, paper engineering, paper automata, and the contemporary DIY electronics, fabrication, and paper craft movements. It will also include field trips to local artist studios and paper mills. Each subject area has associated readings, hands-on exercises, and a final creative work that addresses all the forms explored.</p>

Can ethical storytelling create a measurable transformative impact in societies? In this course, students will explore the intersection of Latino migration and mental health, using ethical storytelling as a guiding principle.  Through practical hands-on experiences, students will acquire essential skills in documentary production. They will learn techniques for conducting interviews, capturing compelling footage, and skillfully editing a short film. Students will craft a powerful visual narrative that will amplify the voices of marginalized migrants.  In addition to conducting fieldwork, students will engage with subject matter experts, including community organizers, scholars, and media professionals. These experts will provide valuable guidance and expertise, enriching the student's understanding of the complexities surrounding migrant communities.  At the end of this course, students will discover how the power of storytelling can cultivate empathy, challenge stereotypes, and contribute to a more inclusive and compassionate society.</p>

                            </p><p>The history of falconry is not a hunting story. It's a story of human imagination of self, society, and the natural world. Approaching falconry as a "social fact" and as an example of what specialists refer to as "intangible heritage," this course asks what human engagements with these birds of prey, across time and culture, reveal about relationships between humans and nature - relationships of ethics and respect, but also of desire and domination. How might a close examination of falconry help explain the emergence and transformation of social categories such as nobility and poverty, male and female, believer and pagan, citizen and foreigner? How might it require us to confront human fragility - our bodily, intellectual, and spiritual limits, our experiences of joy, love, youth, death, faith, science, and more? Engaging with texts, images, and films, students will ask how humans use non-human species to understand and define ourselves, our civilizations, and our aspirations across a range of ethnic, religious, historical, and geographical differences.<br>NOTE: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a seminar in Italy.</p>

                            </p><p>Students in this course study representations of selves - their own, others', collectives, and non-selves -- in literature, art, film and music. Examples come from around the world; mostly contemporary and Modern but we won't ignore ancient and pre-Modern.  A kernel-question guides our investigations: can selves/not-selves be known in artistic expressions, and if so, how and why?  Autobiography, self-portraiture, and self-referential music and films will be primary texts, classified into four different voices: confession, accusation, aggregation, and nomothetic. Expect to read works by Whitman, Kincaid, Woolf, Gandhi, Borges, Xun, and Stein.  Examples of portrait artists to be studied include Rembrandt, Leyster, van Gogh, Kahlo, and Warhol. Filmmakers who practice self-representation will include Deren, and Varda. Music by Beyoncé, Ono/Lennon, ali-Khan, and Marvi will be studied.</p>

                            </p><p>The garden is one of the oldest modes of human intervention in the environment, but what has made it such a productive and enduring symbol and practice? This course explores the garden as a major art form by focusing on pictorial and spatial representations of the Garden of Eden. The Edenic Paradise of Genesis and the Qur'an where Adam and Eve transgressed against God gives access to thought about gardens in the ancient Middle East. As a foundational idea in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The history of Eden in the art of the Peoples of the Book is closely entwined with that of garden design, and this seminar examines both. The course introduces fundamental methods of art history as students examine gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, Medieval Christianity, Arabian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Enlightenment cities, Persian court miniatures, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. Field trips, once public health regulations allow, include outings to gardens and collections in the United Arab Emirates, and the seminar concludes with a collaborative garden design project in Abu Dhabi.</p>

                            </p><p>Stories about migrants and migration are told in various registers, genres and media forms. Inflected by geopolitical and historical contexts, migration is perceived and narrated variously as a national or global crisis, a humanitarian emergency, an ideological and racialized minefield or as accounts of individualized trauma or success. As borders and mobility have become contested topics on the global stage, media platforms and practices profoundly shape the circulation and the contours of migration narrative. Berlin offers a particularly rich site to study both historical and contemporary issues concerning diaspora, mobility and Otherness. Through a critical engagement with public discourse, scholarly readings from interdisciplinary sources and field trips, the course will examine the political and cultural imaginaries that construct and surveil the lives of migrants in the specific cityscape of Berlin.</p>

                            </p><p>By default, you are a consumer of immersive experiences if you've been to a 3D or IMAX movie; if you've tried a virtual reality headset; if you've listened to music on surround sound speakers; if you've explored an interactive website or visual album; or if you've attended Burning Man or Disneyland. One of the main drivers of culture and technology, immersion is the process by which one or more of the senses become saturated as environmental objects surround, envelope, or come in closer proximity to us. In the 21st century, immersion has become a multi-billion global business. But it is not new. Theorists like Walter Benjamin and Guy Debord have long been concerned with theorizing the sensory aspects of media spectacle. In this class, students will explore the history and culture of immersion and we will investigate how emergent technology has impacted immersion. We especially look at immersion in popular culture - from Satie to Björk; to ambient music and panoramic sound; to theme parks and escape rooms; to haunted houses and holograms. Given Los Angeles' thriving immersive entertainment scene, students can expect to hear from notable guest speakers and to take special field trips.</p>

                            </p><p>How has the current migration crisis transformed understandings of nation and nationality and what role have the performing arts played in this transformation? What ethical considerations come into play when venues represent migrants or incorporate migrant performers in works of art? This class examines recent work by and about political and economic refugees in the performing and visual arts, with an emphasis on French theatre. With over 65 million displaced people, the world is in the throes of the worst migration crisis since the Second World War. In the midst of new barriers to displaced people, arts institutions have opened their doors to migrant artists and representations of migrants. The work has ranged from adaptations of classic works, verbatim theatre pieces, film projects, migrant ensembles, drama therapy projects, and political activism combining live performance and social media campaigns. Class materials will include plays by Wajdi Mouwad, Wael Qadour, Koffi Kwahulé, Marwan Bulbul, and Ian Soliane, and critical works by Arjun Appadurai, Éric Fassin, Emile Chabal, and Stephan Scheel and Vicki Squire. There will be class visits to the Institut du Monde Arabe, Le Centre Pompidou and two dance performances at the Théâtre National de Chaillot.</p>

                            </p><p>The Bible - in different versions - is sacred to Jews and Christians and plays an important role in Islam. It is similarly influential in modern politics, philosophy, literature, and art. Because of its sacred status, religious communities have constantly interpreted the Bible in order to renew its meaning for new and diverse settings. Non-religious communities read and interpret the Bible stripped of its sacred status, but with an awareness of its significance for so much of the world population. The course uses the Bible as a case study to examine how groups and individuals interpret and reinterpret an authoritative text in order to adapt it to new social and cultural circumstances. We explore this big question through our examination of the reception of the Bible among diverse communities of Jews, Christians, Muslims and other ancient and modern groups. There are no prerequisites. The course invites students with and without prior knowledge about the Bible to reflect critically on its origins and how its reinterpretations have varied in time and place. Co-curricular opportunities allow students to engage with biblical interpretation in unique settings.</p>

                            </p><p>We often think of movements in music as the self-contained parts of a composition, but music also moves society through its ability to foster belonging and becoming. How are new music scenes and movements constituted within societies? How do cultural diversity, narrative building and cultural strategies facilitate the development of contemporary music movements? How can urban and contemporary music create greater social and economic inclusion? This course will use music in Morocco as a case study for understanding how vibrant contemporary music scenes are created and sustained in the context of cultural diversity and migration, and how urban youth draw inspiration from a cultural heritage at the crossroads of Africa, Europe, and the Arab world. The case study will initiate debate and stimulate research about the possibilities for developing a vibrant music scene in Abu Dhabi. Students will have the opportunity to conduct a comparative field visit in Morocco and learn from artists, music industry professionals as well as experts from cultural institutions from the UAE and Morocco. The course will culminate in students’ developing proposals for a thriving urban and contemporary music scene in Abu Dhabi. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a seminar in Morocco.</p>

                            </p><p>A bottle of olive oil, a basket of warm bread, platters of fresh produce, grilled fish: these are stock images of the Mediterranean diet. Cuisine is an integral part of Mediterranean foodways - attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors associated with food production, preparation, and consumption. How do foodways relate to forms of social difference, including ethnicity, gender, class, and nationality? How do Mediterranean foodways engage with the political, economic, and cultural processes of globalization? What have been the effects of mass migration across the Mediterranean on its foodways? What are some lessons about sustainability that we can learn from the Mediterranean? Students will explore the intersections of food, culture, and politics through analysis of the Mediterranean diet, food markets, the Slow Food movement, and the challenges of global food production, including sustainability and the problem of food waste. Case studies from around the Mediterranean as well as film viewings and field excursions (including food tastings!) will enable students to appreciate of the multiple and contradictory ways traditions are created and recreated in a globalized Mediterranean.</p>

                            </p><p>A booming multinational industry that plays a critical role in the global economy, tourism is among the most powerful mediums of transnational encounter. Tourism is implicated in the histories of pilgrimage, colonialism, and ethnography, successfully retracing their itineraries and replicating their discourse. Before the industry ground to a halt worldwide due to the pandemic, we were at a tipping point in many destinations, from UNESCO World Heritage sites in European cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Prague, and Venice to ancient cities like Machu Pichu in Peru or Angkor Wat in Cambodia. "Overtourism" has once again become common parlance as the industry rapidly returns to pre-pandemic levels - from backpackers to mass tourists. The need to rebuild sustainably for a new era of travel responsibility is imperative. The course will explore the political economy and the cultural and environmental impact of tourism through an ethnographic examination of actual sites. Particular emphasis will be placed on travel stories circulating in print, social media, and exhibitions spaces such as museums, cinema, and TV - exploring their role in shaping our experiences and destination perspectives.</p>

In this course we approach visual art as an invitation to slow looking, an adventure of observation and thought based in receptivity rather than preformulated ideas. Besides learning a protocol for sustained observation, students will receive intensive training in analytical method. How do we gather observations without immediately harnessing them into schemas? How do we pass from observations to a set of questions, and then explore those questions? We will, however, explore not only what slow looking can let us see but also what it cannot let us see. In repeated visits to three major museums in Madrid we will do slow looking in person. Students will engage in discussion of works of art and write frequent short writing assignments. We will also read and analyze essays that exemplify the art of slow looking.</p>

                            </p><p>How have immigrant artists "remade their worlds" in conditions of exile? In turn, how have their experiences abroad impacted culture in their homelands? How do past migrations compare to current migrations, especially for artists? What are the implications of transnational migration for artists, especially regarding constructions of race, gender, and belonging? This seminar analyzes the experience of African American artists in Paris, from the early 20th century until today. Students will explore the conditions that precipitated the migration of African American artists to France and analyze the cultural impact they had on Paris, and of Paris on their art. We will also examine how African American expats reconciled their newfound status with that of migrants from France's former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean. Through readings, films, and visits to museums, monuments and other cultural sites, we will explore the indelible mark African American artists left on their adopted city, and on global visual, literary and intellectual culture.</p>

                            </p><p>World Dance and Global Perspectives: How does dance reflect cultural heritage and serve as a key to understanding diverse societies? How might dance encode a society’s religious, artistic, political, and economic values? How have migration, colonialism, trade and diaspora led to the creation of dance forms like “Bollywood” and “K-Pop”? Because dance is both a tradition and a living presence whose social functions are continually evolving, how might we decolonize dance in order to rediscover indigenous forms? This class will examine dance as an encoded and embodied expression of culture. We will explore issues of race, gender, and class to understand the body as an archive of memory. We will study different global dances through readings, video, and movement. Through dance classes students will experience dance and the trance-like powers of music. Each student will research a form of their choice and choreograph their own world dance that addresses our present moment and global issues. Students will be researchers, performers, and creators, revealing how dance can be a powerful tool for research as well as expression and community building. Student dances and group work will be brought together for a final performance.</p>

                            </p><p>How do we reconcile the marketing of tropical islands as "paradises," catering to tourist fantasies despite their troubled, often violent histories?  Starting with recognition of this fundamental paradox, this course asks, can meaningful parallels be drawn between the 'paradisical' Caribbean Islands and the Indian Ocean island of Zanzibar? Utilizing readings, films and music, this interdisciplinary course explores and compares the enduring social, cultural and economic consequences of histories of colonization on these islands. We will examine how and why their economic development has been tied to marketing the islands as "paradisiacal" destinations; students will travel Zanzibar to undertake qualitative observation of its tourism products and resorts for a capstone presentation on tourism provision there. Questions we will explore include: to what extent have Indian Ocean and Caribbean geographies contributed to both similarities and differences in socioeconomic developments? In what ways are the impacts of historical forces on the sociocultural formation of the Caribbean islands and Zanzibar similar? In what ways has tourism benefited or changed the societies of these islands?  Pending international travel conditions this course will include a regional academic seminar to Zanzibar.</p>

                            </p><p>Loss and Nostalgia: Mourning Al Andalus:   What is loss and Nostalgia? Why and how do humans grieve and how is grieving affected by the type of loss?  How is grief socially regulated? How and when is grieving given ideological meaning? What are the historical and contemporary conceptualizations of nostalgia? Is nostalgia a medical disease, an emotion, does it serve an existential function? How does a geographical place evoke a deep sense of loss and nostalgia, both individual and communal? This course will study the theoretical underpinnings of grief and nostalgia within the historical, psychological, philosophical, literary, artistic, and anthropological parameters. It will focus on one case study to explore how the loss of Al-Andalus was grieved and articulated in the pre-modern historical and literary sources, in Arabic and Hebrew, to form narratives of divine decree, justice, self-realization, communal self, among others. The course will also discuss how the loss of Al-Andalus and the nostalgia about that “lost paradise” have been recaptured in the modern period, in the various art forms (novels, poetry, movies, and music), in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, to serve modern ideologies, and self and communal awareness.</p>

                            </p><p>Problematizing the binary of 'tradition' and 'the contemporary' as two isolated categories, separated by time, history and culture, this course will question: How do we see the 'contemporary' in 'tradition'? In the process, how can we develop a more fluid concept of time, where the past, present and future can intersect to form new synergies of understanding the performative self in relation to society and politics? These questions will be confronted through an immersive experiential process of viewing traditional performances in Kerala, India, on the actual site of the legendary Kerala Kalamandalam. Apart from examining the aesthetics and training processes of Kutiyattam (the oldest 'living tradition' of Sanskrit theatre) and Nangyarkuttu (the earliest tradition of solo women's performance in world theatre), the course will interrogate the social contexts of these traditions in conversation with leading contemporary performers and directors in India. Thinking through debates around gender and caste, the students will be encouraged to subvert essentialized readings of the past to arrive at new paradigms of tradition-inspired psychophysical knowledge. Pending international travel conditions this course will include a regional academic seminar to India.</p>

                            </p><p>A City's Essence: London, Past, Present and Future:   What makes a city? Is a city anything more than a large aggregate of people? Does a city’s essence lie in its monuments, its historical strata, its millennia-spanning narratives? Is it in geology and geography, heroic feats of engineering, innovative infrastructure? How productive is it even to think of a city as a singular entity? Using as a case study London, a city significantly constituted by aristocracy and empire, this class investigates how to locate the contemporary within the metropolis. Where is the nowness of this place and how much of it is informed by its past? Where can we find its social and cultural edges that may go on to become part of its future legends? This interdisciplinary class, spanning the arts and sciences, looks at London through a variety of lenses including food, data, water, medicine, childhood, finance. It will include a wide roster of field trips and also offer sustained access to field-leading artists, curators and public intellectuals. Students will have the freedom to work on creative, collaborative and multi-disciplinary research projects.</p>

                            </p><p>When the Moors Ruled in Europe: Medieval Convivencia and its Cultural Legacies:   This course examines the cultures of coexistence between Muslims, Jews and Christians in medieval Iberia and their legacies in the greater Mediterranean world. We will first consider how Spain’s medieval convivencia transformed cities such as Toledo, Córdoba and Granada into leading European centers of knowledge. Subsequently, we will uncover how port cities such as Palermo, Livorno and Tunis emerged as spaces of religious tolerance after the expulsion of the Moors from the Iberian peninsula at the dawn of the modern era. In keeping with this two-fold approach, we will consider the porous boundaries of Europe during a period when terms such as “Moors,” “Christians” and “Jews” were still in flux. Among the critical questions that will inform our discussions are the following: How did medieval convivencia help spark the European Renaissance? What do works by Muslim, Jewish and Christian authors suggest about the nature of religious, ethnic and gender identity in medieval and early modern multicultural contexts? What can the Iberian cultures of medieval convivencia (and their diasporic legacies) teach us about the possibilities of interfaith dialogue and the ethics of hospitality today?</p>

                            </p><p>Africans in Europe: History, Memory, Belonging:    Increasingly vocal xenophobic discourses across Europe frame migrants as an existential threat – what is referred to as the “migration crisis.” This is especially the case when the migrants come from Africa. Yet, Africans have been present in Europe for centuries, prompting us to ask, What is Europe? What is European? This course introduces students to the long history of Africans in Europe through three main lenses. The first explores the Afro-European past to develop critical counterpoints to a series of key moments in history: the Renaissance, the Age of Revolutions, the two world wars, and the global 1960s. The second attends to the question of memory: How is the Afro-European past remembered and debated? What role does this memory play in different European contexts? The third centers on the notion of diaspora: How have people of African descent in Europe negotiated their belonging in multiple geographical spaces? What is the significance of the African diaspora in Europe for the African continent itself? Students will explore these questions in the context of the complex African past, and present, in Paris.</p>

                            </p><p>All Power to the Imagination: Surrealism and the Magical Prague:   How can the artists’ desire to participate in social change link to the fantastic explorations of their imaginaries? How does the condemnation of fascism connect with an artistic re-envisioning of social conventions and norms? Is any revolution primarily a liberation of our unconscious, of our ability to dream? The mystery of Prague, a city known for the presence of alchemists, astrologists, and esoteric thinkers, inspired the work of surrealist and avant-garde artists in the interwar era. This seminar will explore the power of the imagination within Czechoslovak art, film, architecture, poetry, and book designs from the 1930s into present times. Students will examine the work of artists and thinkers who attempted to move “against the current” of tradition and into greater freedom by asserting the right to wildly dream, question gender roles, and create revolutionary links between housing and socio-economic justice. Through readings, films, urban walks and visits to Prague’s architecture, and art museums, we will explore the sustained impact of surrealism as a poetic and political force.</p>

                            </p><p>This course will explore the relationship between the rich photographic cultures represented in two collections from across the globe: the Akkasah Photography Archive at New York University Abu Dhabi and a selection of vernacular photographs of African American life from the NYC-based Peter Cohen Collection. What insights about photography and practices of archiving come to light when vernacular photographs from the Arab world and African American life are put in dialog? How might these cultural practices already be in dialogue? While addressing the limitations and possibilities of comparative and relational frameworks, this course will engage issues central to the critical consideration of photography through a close look at the photographic realm of the quotidian. In doing so, this course will help students articulate the structures that enable such a project to take place, from issues of access, value, the cultural implications of each archive, subversive acts of looking and the advantages and drawbacks to considering these two different selections of photographs side by side. Photographic formats, their histories and how these histories impact global/local/regional circulation and structures of visibility will also be considered. Of utmost importance will be the regular close looking and handling of photographic objects. This hands-on engagement allows students to not only consider the cultural significance of photographs but also their very status as objects to be physically held within the context of investigative leaps, entanglements, and resonances from across the globe.</p>

                            </p><p>How does nostalgia influence our understanding of the past? Is it possible to construct a memory of the past through reading memoirs, historical documents, photographs, and historic maps? Can we separate the act of memory from our everyday lives and existence? Through exploring the dynamics of late Ottoman Istanbul, this class will consider how current societies transform how we understand the past, while also providing us with a platform to imagine the future. Focusing on early 20th-century Istanbul, which was inhabited by multi-linguistic urban dwellers, we will study the diverse ethnic and religious groups that once filled the streets. After introducing the students to multiple narratives of the past, we will travel to Istanbul, where we will use its neighborhoods as "sites of memories" in search of remnants of the past. We will examine how the state constructs memories through architecture and urban spaces, while working to discern what memories and histories have been erased from today's collective memory. By visiting mosques, churches, and synagogues and meeting with local cultural foundations, we will focus on how understandings of modernity created divided societies and new forms of nationalism. Once back in Abu Dhabi, we will visit different sites, examining if the UAE can serve as a model for the post-Ottoman states to rethink their own sense of nationalism within today’s world. Pending international travel conditions this seminar will include a regional academic seminar to Turkey.</p>

                            </p><p>"Every contact leaves a trace." This phrase, coined by the pioneer of forensic science Edmond Locard, is the starting point of all forensic investigations. Scientific measurements are used to discover traces left at the crime scene and connect them to a person, object, or place. But what is it about science that allows us to make these connections? And how are facts determined by scientific measurements different from those recorded during an interrogation? Does the word "fact" carry the same meaning in the legal system as it does to you or to an experienced scientist? In this course, students explore these questions while analyzing samples left at a crime scene using biological, chemical, and physical laboratory techniques used in forensics. Exploring the underlying scientific principles and analyzing adjudicated cases, they discuss the capabilities and limitations of forensics, how it relates to the criminal justice system, and its impact on society.</p>

In fact, humanity’s survival as we know it depends on finding ways to maintain societal progress while living healthily within the carrying capacity of the Earth. This course introduces students to the concepts, literature, scientific methods, data, and practices of sustainable development both globally and locally. We start with history and global observations, and gradually work our way to regional and local issues involving people, industries, ecosystems, and governments. From the environmental realm, topics covered include the use of energy, water, and other resources, emissions, climate change, and human and ecological health impacts. We review the economic implications of pathways to a sustainable future. In all our discussions, societal impacts such as equity, wealth, and justice are considered, and discovery of data needs and analysis are explored.</p>

                            </p><p>How people view and treat the dead depends upon their culture; and these views can vary across time and space. Only the human skeleton can provide unbiased evidence of past lived experiences. Our skeleton is not a rigid frame that is fixed once we reach adulthood: it is a living and dynamic organ that changes in response to our activity, nutrition and disease. This multidisciplinary seminar uses human skeletal material from Florence and greater Italy who lived during the medieval period to teach data collection methods, as well as biological anthropological standards to estimate sex, age at death, and stature of people in the past. Students will learn to analyze skeletal stress markers and indicators of activity patterns to reconstruct past behavior. They will learn methods for assessing diet and health, including identifying infectious diseases, traumatic lesions and other skeletal pathologies. Discussion topics include the ethics of studying human remains, as well as cultural differences in how human bodies are viewed and treated in death. The final project will culminate in an osteobiography of an individual from medieval Italy, placing them in the context of their population as well as a larger context of medieval Europe. Students will be working with ancient human remains or casts in a laboratory setting.</p>

                            </p><p>Public health is the science of protecting and improving the health of people and their communities. This requires accurate and timely data on many events and diseases so that health policies and interventions can be adequately designed, implemented, and evaluated. How can public health data be generated within the complexity of communities and health facilities? How can these data be transformed into metrics that inform policy decisions? How do these processes play out in economic settings, where health and data systems face severe resource constraints? Pending feasible international travel conditions the course will take place in Ghana, a lower-middle-income country. Students will learn about the production of public health data through readings, data visualization, and field visits to sites where public health data are collected, processed, or discussed. Throughout the course, students will work in teams on a data-driven project aimed at addressing the barriers that limit the registration of births in Ghana, an issue that confounds a broad array of health statistics related to maternal and child health.</p>

                            </p><p>What distinguishes living organisms from non-living systems, and how did the latter transition to living? How do organisms evolve, and can we expect to find life elsewhere in the universe like ours? Answering these questions allows us to better understand life on our planet and how new evolutionary trajectories can arise, resulting in the appearance of more complex species as well as new viruses and pathogens. The course begins with analyzing the distinguishing features of living organisms and examining the boundaries that non-living systems had cross to become living. The class then explores how extant organisms use their DNA as blueprints to replicate themselves and evolve. In the last segment, students will learn how researchers are editing DNA and have re-written life's genetic code to generate synthetic life indistinguishable from natural ones. The course uses lectures and laboratory exercises to interrogate these questions.</p>

How do we measure sustainability in relation to transportation? In this class students will engage with the many public policy challenges current transportation systems face, from environmental quality and social equity to economic vitality and the threat of climate change. Readings, discussions and assignments will offer an overview of theories, policies, and implementation tools for advancing sustainable transportation and urbanization programs and help students appreciate the complexities of varying contexts and practices. Beginning with analysis of worldwide trends and projections for urbanization and urban travel, students will examine key transportation planning and policy issues raised by current conditions, trends, and projections. Drawing on case studies from emerging economies as well as developed cities, students will conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis of transportation modes as well as operations and management strategies that can be used to increase sustainability. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a seminar in Germany.</p>

                            </p><p>Seascapes under siege:   Nearly 40 percent of the world’s population live within 100 km of the coast. Coastal seascapes are productive and diverse land-sea systems that provide valuable benefits. However, the growth and demands of the services they provide are posing an ever greater threat to their ecological integrity. How do we protect seascapes that are increasingly under siege from human interventions and human-induced climate change? Can technological advances reverse the tide of seascape depletion by allowing for more effective management? What actions can be taken to halt the destructive impacts of the climate crisis and the human alteration of these coastal seascapes? This course will explore technological advances in the interface of environmental monitoring and the arts. The class will train students in seascape mapping using machine-learning workflows in open-source applications. The course includes a study trip to Al Saadiyat Marine National Park for data collection using image systems and field data. Ocean literacy using results from the analysis can help local communities to protect their own coastal seascapes to preserve their ecology and their valuable benefits.</p>

                            </p><p>This course seeks to address a central question: although societies drastically differ from one another, why is inequality such a common and persistent characteristic? We will approach this question from both theoretical and empirical perspectives to better understand inequalities by gender, race/ethnicity, immigration/migration status, nationality, sexuality, and the intersection of these lenses. A particular focus will be placed on Shanghai and the urban-rural and migration divides that organize much of Chinese society. Students will learn to critically analyze different forms of inequality and inequities. Readings from this course will cover ideas such as those proposed in early texts by Karl Marx and more contemporary arguments made by Black feminists such as Patricia Hill Collins.</p>

                            </p><p>How do a series of sometimes disparate beliefs about issues come together to form an ideology? How do ideologies change and reform over time? In this course, we explore these fundamental questions about beliefs in societies across the globe. We begin by defining ideologies and looking at examples from key intellectual movements of the last millennium (e.g., crusaderism/jihadism, liberalism, communism, fascism, religious nationalism, ethnic nationalism). In this intellectual journey, we read some of the great thinkers who have shaped the concept of ideology over time, including Burke, Marx, Mussolini, and (Benedict) Anderson. Thereafter, we look at how to measure ideologies. Students are introduced to quantitative tools for assessing ideologies from both individual-level surveys, voting behavior, and text (e.g., speeches and Twitter).

                            </p><p>The design of our cities and buildings shapes our health and well-being. The Coronavirus pandemic reinforced mounting evidence about the spatial determinants of both infectious and non-infectious diseases. Drawing on approaches from public health, urban and transport planning, architectural design, sociology, psychology and neuroscience, students will be challenged to think beyond the confines of a single discipline. A social justice framework guides the analysis of technical issues. The insights gained will benefit future designers, but also those who choose careers as policy makers and health practitioners; who employ architects for residential and workplace projects; and who, as citizens and activists, hope to make the places in which they live, work and relax better for everyone. Readings include case studies from Europe and North America, and new research from the Gulf. Students will learn through interactive lectures and classroom discussions and debates; the screening of documentary films and TED talks; one small ethnographic project on campus; a field visit in Abu Dhabi; a close analysis of their own university campus; and a design project on Saadiyat Island.</p>

                            </p><p>Starting from the premise that disability is a social phenomenon, rather than an individual and medical one, this course asks: How do media and technology shape disability? And how might disability activism and disability studies inform better design? We will consider the significance of technology to the definition and experience of disability in a cross-cultural perspective. Topics include: universal and critical design; the contested category of "assistive technology"; visual rhetorics of disability in photography and film; staring and other practices of looking; disability aesthetics; biomedicine/biotech and the establishment of norms. Drawing on disability arts and activism, we will also practice techniques for media accessibility such as captioning, alt text, plain language, and video description. Note: Pending feasible travel conditions we will hold lessons on disability aesthetics and museum access at Louvre Abu Dhabi among other art spaces. We will also partner with Mawaheb Art Studio for People of Determination to help them make their exhibition for the Quoz Arts Festival accessible. Following the disability activist principle "nothing about us without us," we will host guest lecturers with a wide range of disability expertise.</p>

                            </p><p>How can we understand climate change? On one level, the unfolding climate crisis is a story of graphs, charts, and scientific evidence. On another level, it is a chorus of present and future narratives of those victimized by their predecessors' short-sighted choices. We will engage climate change on both levels. Our discussions center on two works of climate fiction that reify the human costs of climate change through narrative and lay bare the intimate connection between our choices and the climate crisis. These works also draw on the physical and social sciences and humanities to illustrate important themes: geo-engineering; the human cost of climate change; the science of prediction; climate-induced conflict; the ethics of violent protest; interdependence; accountability and governance; and the problematic primacy of human life on Earth. In each meeting, we discuss a few fiction chapters together with shorter works on the science, ethics, and meaning of climate change.</p>

                            </p><p>Human activities are having an unprecedented impact on the planet. This course examines some of the most serious environmental threats facing humanity and how they are being managed, if at all. Topics include: climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and sustainable development. For each of these issues we will investigate a set of central questions, including: The Science: What is the scientific basis for acting on this issue? How much scientific uncertainty is there and how does it impact the development of policy? The Policy: How have national governments and the international community dealt with this issue so far, if at all? What institutions have been created? How has responsibility for action been allocated?  The Actors: What role are various actors playing - from business to indigenous groups? What are their interests? Do they help or hinder action?</p>

Our central concern is to understand how pandemic disease mobility interacts with territorial social formations; with that concern, we focus particularly on the expanding scale of pandemic mobility among territorial structures of social power and inequity. We travel to Bangladesh to study the complexity of pandemic health environments in poverty environments. We will spend three full days in class and in field visits at the James P. Grant School of Public Health, at the International Center for Diarrheal Diseases Research, Bangladesh.

                            </p><p>How do buildings and public space - architecture and infrastructure - shed light on larger social, economic, and cultural dynamics? What goes into the making of transnational cities? We will take as our primary cases the cities of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Paris. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are extreme cases of transnational cities, each having great wealth, transnational connections, and distinctive modes of planning, resource use, and citizenship. The Gulf is, in many ways, a lab to see how cities connect internationally and transform locally. Paris has been a model for other cities in the West and the Middle East - the UAE included. Paris will provide evidence of how Gulf cities are linked in complex networks of planning, finance, and consumption. Through engagement with local experts and practitioners, site visits and multidisciplinary explorations in these three cities, students will become able to "see" how concepts of urban policy and architectural design 'travel," land, hybridize, or come into conflict locally. With continuous attention to broader social and environmental effects, we will investigate the prospects for governing, transforming, and reforming emerging global cities.

                            </p><p>What are the promises and perils of global solidarity movements that center feminist praxis? What colonial legacies and contemporary practices complicate this venture? How, for instance, is feminist rhetoric weaponized in the service of transnational capital and the interests of nation-states? To address these and other questions, this course brings transnational feminist thought - which opens up ways to negotiate historically fraught, easily sensationalized practices such as veiling and 'sweatshop' labor - into conversation with critical development studies, which problematizes neoliberal progress narratives embedded in dominant discourses of female empowerment. Readings will be complemented by a field trip to Dhaka, Bangladesh, a paradigmatic 'global' space where struggles over Islam, development, and transnational capital have been at the forefront of feminist and labor rights movements. Discussions with activists, workers, and policy makers will allow students to gain a deeper appreciation of the interlocking forces that connect everyday lives and labors across global spaces. Specific topics studied include supply chains and garment workers, micro-credit and financialization, and religious extremism and the girl child. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a regional seminar in Bangladesh.</p>

                            </p><p>International Peacebuilding and the Role of Education: How do state and nonstate actors build peaceful, inclusive states and societies? What is the role of education in this process? And how might peace agreements, peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, or conspiracy theories and disinformation factor in? This seminar explores the politics of conflict, peacebuilding, humanitarianism and the role of education in promoting violence or peace. Preliminary case studies include Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, the US. We will meet with local and international organizations supporting peacebuilding (e.g., QRF, Human Rights Watch, LEGO, UNHCR, USAID) as well as activists in exile. We will consider conflict-affected populations’ access to quality education during conflict or displacement, refugee migration, reconstruction, and peacebuilding. The class includes a seminar in Greece, in collaboration with the class Reporting on Migration to meet with displaced populations and work in partnership with Refocus Media Labs, an organization that specializes in training refugee youth in media arts and migration reporting. Students will produce a short research article while in Greece in addition to several other writing assignments in Abu Dhabi. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a regional seminar in Greece.</p>

                            </p><p>The Media, Climate Crisis and other Calamities: The world is facing crises on a global scale at a time when the media has also gone global. How is information on the climate crisis, global pandemics, and other calamities covered and disseminated by the mainstream press and social media? What is the role of communication play in serving as an early warning system to induce urgent, inter-generational change in human behavior to address these threats? What are the ethics of reporting on people affected by the climate emergency? This course analyzes mass media coverage of both sudden disasters and slow-moving crises. Earthquakes and floods are "natural disasters", but the death and destruction they cause are often human-induced. We will take the Himalayan ecology, and culture, along with current and future climate impact as a case study of adaptation and mitigation. We examine how social media has transformed the way citizens receive, spread, and react to information and how those responses impact policy. We also explore how information technology has determined the way society is informed about calamities and its response. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions students will travel to Nepal for a regional academic seminar. Students should expect to do hiking.</p>

                            </p><p>What constitutes a leader? What are the relationships of leaders to innovation, organizational and societal change? The dynamic shifts taking place in societies and organizations globally increasingly require leaders to be agile learners, be self-aware of strengths and growth areas, and be adept at leading by influence, with and through others. Moreover, these leadership skills, among others, are also foundational for innovating at organizational and systems levels, leveraging diverse human talent and potential while being open to new ideas and adaptive approaches to ever changing circumstances in our lives and communities. To successfully lead and innovate, does place matter? Does context matter? Does genealogy and gender matter? Do[es] people [individual characteristics] matter? In this course students will learn leadership theory and frameworks; how they are applied in cross-sectoral environments; and explore how design thinking principles foster innovation and change. The course leverages resources in the local context of Abu Dhabi where students will examine how leadership and innovation are taking shape in this context and how they align with the goals outlined in Abu Dhabi 2030. For J-Term 2024 students, they will participate in a Summit on Innovation and Leadership at NYUAD as part of this course.</p>

                            </p><p>The course addresses these major questions: What is identity? What is the nature of social identity? How do gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, nationality, culture, and religion define or influence our identities? Which of those elements affect who we are? How does material culture - buildings, paintings, sculptures, and other artifacts - play a role in shaping identities? We begin with ideas about the nature of social identities - like gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, nationality, culture, and religion - developing an account of their general structure. Next, we look at how identities matter in shaping our lives and our well-being, and why that matters for ethics. Finally, we'll look at gender, sexuality, race, nationality, class, culture, and religion in particular, before ending with a discussion of political identities in contemporary democratic politics. We'll use the British Museum to look at how material culture plays a role in shaping identities, and visit two other significant sites of identity in London: the East End, a site for new immigrant communities; and Parliament Square. We will discuss how sites shape identity and identity shapes sites.</p>

                            </p><p>Are you ready to leave Earth and work in space in your lifetime? The space economy is expected to become a trillion-dollar economy by 2040, and "made in space" may flourish soon. How will space economy inform our future economies and lives? What competencies will be needed to be part of the space economy and outer space affairs? How important are space and space economy for a socio-economic sustainable development? How can decision and policy makers tackle global challenges with the support of space technologies? And how dependent are the 17 Sustainable Development goals of the UN 2030 Agenda for sustainable development from space? With space and non-space technologies and related skills on the rise in the world, we understand "space for space" and "space for Earth" as the two main pillars for the integration between new frontier technologies. The class will also explore how the democratization of space increases access to space and brings with it the need to maintain the safety, security, and sustainability of outer space activities to ensure a commercially viable, sustainable, green, and safe space environment for a reliable future for humanity.

                            </p><p>In a post-truth world, we wrestle with questions such as, "What is evidence?" "What is enough evidence?" "Is objectivity irrelevant or even impossible?" And, most basically, "What is news anyway?" News. Evidence. Truth? will explore the strategies and social dynamics of one of the media's most revelatory forms: investigative journalism. Through case histories and by interviewing highly regarded journalists, the class will analyze how media organizations executed text, aural and visual investigations, including their methods of gathering information and modes of presentation. We will also explore journalism's increasing reliance on data in story construction. Students will put theory into practice by assuming the roles of reporters in a newsroom. They will collaboratively produce news stories and undergo the news editing process. They will develop reporter-to-editor memos that summarize research on investigative projects and propose strategies for further reporting. They will gain heightened understanding of the media, deepened insights into the interplay of fact and rhetoric, and sharpened capacities to synthesize and convey information.</p>

                            </p><p>Around the world, the labor of paid and unpaid care is being transformed by global migration flows, in addition to changing demographics, the increasing labor force participation of native women, and the advent of new communication technologies. More and more families are relying on migrant domestic workers to care for children and elderly dependents. But how does this care across borders impact the lives of the migrant domestic workers and their own kin? Who cares for the children these migrants leave behind in their home countries? Is sending financial remittances from overseas to support their left-behind families equivalent to being physically present in their children’s lives? Is the labor of caring for one’s family and other people’s families sufficiently valued (and remunerated) in the twenty-first century? How do migrant domestic workers engage in self- and community-care overseas? Students will explore these questions by engaging with feminist scholarship on migration, domestic work and care labor. Students will analyze the care policy regimes in the United Arab Emirates and Singapore to understand how migrant domestic workers engage in transnational carework in these countries and with their families back home, and how their carework is perceived and protected. Pending feasible international travel conditions this course will include a regional academic seminar to Singapore.</p>

                            </p><p>Why do disparities in health outcomes exist according to social factors such as immigration status, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and gender? How do social contexts like networks and community environments shape health risks? How can public policies such as immigration, zoning and educational policies – policies designed with no explicit focus on health – have significant health effects? Students in this course will learn about the relationship between human health and social forces. We will focus on how social factors shape patterns and experiences of health and illness for individuals and populations—not simply through their impact on accessing medical care, but also via many other mechanisms or pathways, such as social and physical environments, discrimination, stress, and access to resources, that may promote or harm health. Students will have the opportunity to interview leading scholars in the sociology of health and will write a research report suggesting concrete policy goals directed towards increasing health equity by targeting social factors.</p>

How is Africa as a continent represented, and constructed, in the media? Is there such a thing as an African representation of Africa? How do the media represent and construct narratives about mass violence? How do journalists covering such atrocities in African contexts balance the quest for coverage with the ethics of representation? Over the last century, several instances of mass violence have unfolded in Africa, the most notable being the 1994 Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi, and ongoing atrocities in Darfur, Central Africa Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This course will investigate how these instances of mass violence have been represented by African media and journalists will. Through focused readings, discussion, and site visits and guest lectures by leading journalists in Rwanda, we will focus on how journalists both generate, and rely on existing repositories of, knowledge. Pending international travel conditions this course will include a regional academic seminar to Rwanda.</p>

Students will consider the role of women across countries/nations with a specific focus on the West and the MENA regions, specifically the UAE and South Africa.  By engaging with various  speakers and texts from different geographical locations, intellectual traditions, such as philosophy, cultural anthropology, political science, history, art, sociology, and economics, students will explore the following questions: How has the role of women and women's leadership shifted? How is "woman and gender" imagined in different national, political, social, and environmental contexts (US, Europe, UAE, South Africa) and how does this intersect with leadership? What are transnational similarities and differences?  How does gender inter-relate to nation, language, identity? What, where, when, how, and who "counts" as "woman"?  What are the tensions and possibilities for synergy across various definitions of women's leadership globally?  In doing so, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the contrasting and emerging definitions of woman gender and leadership in relation to emerging and  practical policy and leadership implications and global interconnectedness. Pending international travel conditions this course will include a regional academic seminar to South Africa.</p>

                            </p><p>The question, who am I? is universal across human societies, but it is intimately shaped by sociohistorical and political contexts. In this course, we explore identity questions related to race and Blackness, such as: What is race and how was it constructed? Who is Black and what does it mean to be Black across time and place? How do we learn about ourselves in relation to Blackness (and anti-Blackness)? Students will engage with multiple texts and materials that explore the subjectivities of racial identity within sociocultural, political, and historical contexts. Through class discussions and activities, journal prompts and qualitative interviewing, we will reflect on racial structures of a global society “as is” as well as Afro-futurism and “figured worlds” to collectively reimagine who and what we are beyond structures of anti-Black racism. Methodologically, students will practice asking real questions and use critical qualitative methods to design an interview protocol, conduct their own identity-focused interview, and analyze and interpret their data to come to new ways of knowing about themselves, each other, and the world.</p>

                            </p><p>What does it mean to be green? How did green become the solution to the dual challenge of urbanization and climate change and its consequent association with specific means and forms of urban development and practices?  Over the last three decades new cities built from scratch, such as ecocities and smart cities, have become the modish way for governments across the world to push for sustainable development in their quest to face numerous challenges.  Governments of the oil-rich Gulf Arab states are no exception but the scale and speed of adopting these forms there and their advancement through hosting global mega-events make them compelling cases to examine.  The Gulf states' new cities are green megaprojects deemed essential to help transition to a post-carbon economy.  This course will answer these questions and many more by introducing students to this phenomenon of new smart ecocities and will focus on greening practices of Arab Gulf States. Students will become familiar with the different approaches governments have adopted to promote sustainable development by exploring a number of megaprojects and mega-events from across the region in lectures and in-class activities.</p>

                            </p><p>What big societal impact are nano-scale materials capable of? How are these earthly minerals  changing our everyday lives? What ethical and social consequences result? Earth has an abundance  of minerals and materials that are “small,” that prior to 30 years ago, were never deeply explored  because they were not visible to the human eyes. Nanometer education also known as  Nanotechnology is the utilization of these earthly minerals with chemical, electrical, mechanical,  optical, magnetic, and thermal properties to create useful/functional materials, devices, and  systems through control/manipulation of matter on the nanometer length scale and exploitation of  their properties which arise because of that scale. Devices made from nanometer materials have  shaped and impacted our daily human lives in many ways including information technology  (computing, communication, memory, and data storage), manufacturing, healthcare (biosensors based chips for COVID-19 detection), medicine (COVID-19 vaccine development), alternative  energy, environment, transportation, space. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and writings,  students in this seminar will gain a multidisciplinary and cross-cultural understanding of nanotechnology and its application to humanity.</p>

                            </p><p>Abu Dhabi has taken a lead role among cities in the Gulf region and Middle East that are rapidly rising as global centers for sports events and sports-led development. Driven by its Vision 2030 strategy, the emirate is promoting sport to spur economic and social innovation in ways that make a positive impact within neighborhoods, between communities, and among nations. This course recognizes Abu Dhabi as a “home ground” for asking the question: How are the cities of today harnessing the power of sport to make the world of tomorrow?  The course uses sport as a starting point for identifying, analyzing, and drawing lessons from a range of people, organizations, and institutions in the business, government, and non-profit sectors that influence our larger world. An emphasis is placed on understanding the thoughts, decisions, actions, relationships, and contexts that propel innovators and entrepreneurs who have shaped the modern global sport ecosystem and the changes it brings to its wider communities. Learning is focused on interlacing current events, historical examples, and industry cases to explore, examine, and interpret patterns and principles of innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>

                            </p><p>How does urban geography mediate the relationship between gender and religion? How is that relationship, in turn, embodied? What types of citizens and subjects are produced by different configurations of space, religion, and gender? This course will examine these questions through the lens of Muslim societies across the Middle East and the globe. During the first week, students will read foundational theories on gender, religion, and embodiment. In the second and third weeks, we will read cutting edge research on gender in contemporary Muslim societies, with a focus on the role of urban environments. Comparing Muslim communities across time and space, we will ask the degree to which Islam can explain different configurations of public piety and moral governance. We will closely examine how religion is used and molded by the state, capitalism, and other social institutions to produce gendered regimes and gendered subjectivities. Fieldwork will take students into the urban landscapes of the UAE. We will visit mosques, community organizations and ethnic enclaves, observing how religion and gender interact in spaces of home, work, play and governance. Assignments will ask students to reflect on the physical environment, how it constrains their own and/or others’ bodies, and the types of subjects and selves produced by these encounters.</p>

                            </p><p>The course focuses on the mechanisms by which educational institutions foster and maintain equalities and inequalities around the world. We first consider the kinds of inequalities that exist in our society, their bases, and some of the policies enacted to target them. We then turn the attention to the analysis of educational practices and structures related to the production and maintenance of equalities and inequalities, with concrete examples both from the Italian case and from a range of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The consequences of educational opportunities of recent reform proposals will be considered and discussed, as will the relation of education to occupational opportunities in selected contexts worldwide. At the end of the course, students will be able to think critically about the linkages between research, policymaking, and practice in improving the quality of education in various country contexts, especially those in LMICs. The course is interactive, dynamic, and complements lectures and in-class debates with experiential learning such as visits to the oldest university in the world (Bologna) and the UNICEF Innocenti Office of Research (Florence).</p>

                            </p><p>We are living in a moment of highly mediatized racial and colonial reckoning. Our seminar will take a historical and interdisciplinary overview of the role of media technologies in shaping the racial grammar, sometimes visible often latent, that constricts ‘knowledge’ about the inequities of modern capitalist dispossession, displacement and death. The first part of seminar will focus on the historical legacies of European and more specifically, British racial and colonial violence which have given rise to “common sense” notions about race, naturalizing uneven distributions of resources, debt, cultural worth and life chances across borders.  Simultaneously, we will consider the history of anti-colonial resistance and anti-racist dissent that has long challenged  British imperialism. The second part of our seminar, will allow students to examine how these historical legacies have played out in the 21st century by focusing on two areas of on-going contestation within the UK and globally: debt and migration. First, we will examine how contemporary British media institutions are addressing the brutal legacy of slavery and indigenous genocide through calls for reparations; and secondly, we will consider the role of both legacy and social media in shaping policies and activism around migration, race and class in post-Brexit London.</p>

                            </p><p>Conflict and violence are pervasive in the world. Violent conflicts erode the fabric of communities by diminishing social bonds and trust. How do societies build peace after violent conflict? How can groups learn to live and work together in peace? Can the wounds of violence heal? This course will tackle these questions by exploring the science and art of building peace in the aftermath of collective violence. We will examine how violent conflict affects individuals, communities, institutions and culture. Then, we will explore whether and how peacebuilding can heal the wounds of collective violence. The peacebuilding strategies that we will cover include intergroup contact, social cohesion interventions, peace education, truth commissions and transitional justice, mass media campaigns, etc. Fieldwork will take students to Bosnia where they will observe the impact of collective violence and explore peacebuilding activities. Students will interact with practitioners to critically assess how peacebuilding strategies have worked in Bosnia. Assignments will ask students to reflect and apply this knowledge to other contexts of their interest. Pending international travel conditions this course will include a regional academic seminar to Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

                            </p><p>Close to 1 billion of the world's population live on less than what is effectively 2 US dollars a day. A child born in Sub-Saharan Africa is nearly 10 times more likely to die as an infant than a child born in the United States, largely of biologically preventable illnesses. Nearly 70 percent of the world's poor aged 15 and over are illiterate. Are these facts necessary? What has and is being done to change them? Topics in development economics are concerned with the pursuit of understanding facts and questions like these. This is a challenging introductory course for college students who are motivated to learn more about what can be done in the fight against global poverty. Through a busy few weeks of immersive learning, students will achieve basic skill development in research design, fieldwork, and data analysis for development economics. Students should expect to conduct fieldwork in rural areas.</p>

                            </p><p>On the Economics of Cities:  Ever since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, what makes some nations rich and others poor has been a central question in economics and history. At the same time, besides the mystery of economic growth, there is the mystery of spatial inequality: why is inequality found at all spatial scales, from the international and regional to the urban and local? About 70% of the earth's land surface is inhabitable, but about 3% only is urban land, clearly indicating the staggering tendency of humans to cluster. The largest 681 metropolitan areas distributed over the globe house about 24% of the world's population but produce 60% of the global output.   Spatial inequality is epitomized by the existence of cities that are characterized by high densities of activities and population. But why do people choose to live in big cities where they pay high rents and endure long commutes? Cities generally offer better amenities, as well as a wide range of local public goods. On top of that, firms in larger cities pay higher wages. But then, why would firms in big cities pay their employees these high wages? In sum, why do cities exist?</p>

                            </p><p>2 credits</p><p>This engineering course is an intensive introduction to innovation philosophies and practices around the broad realms of the iterative design process (discover, ideate, make, expose). The majority of the course revolves around hands-on team-based challenges that expose students to multiple engineering domains (electronic, software, mechanical, etc.) as well design domains (design thinking, visual-design, rapid prototyping, product-design, industrial-design). The course culminates in a final innovation and prototyping challenge, the outputs of which are presented in a public exhibition. The course touches on cultural, ethical, and economic factors that must inform the innovation process to maximize its positive social impact.

                            </p><p>Famously building on Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto of 1848 - Soviet socialism charted a profound alternative to western developmental models of economy, society, and a just world. The goal was to redirect the human energies that had already built so much through industrial capitalism. Property needed to be fundamentally rethought, along with the very concepts of family, labor, and the common good. Humans, themselves, would be remade. To get there, the masses would need to be "escorted into History," and cinema played a leading role. In the words of Trotsky, it would become the government's new church. With a wide-ranging look at socialism on screen, this course introduces students to film theory and criticism, histories of socialism, and creative approaches to political economy. We include key sites around Prague to fully grasp the experiential dimensions of all at stake, from some of the city's oldest churches to its most famous cinema halls, from the German WWII camps on the outskirts to today's National Film Museum, and with guest speakers on a youth spent in movie halls under the socialist era's Prague Spring.</p>

                            </p><p>This course offers a practice-based approach to unpacking and engaging critical issues at the core of documentary filmmaking.  What is a documentary film? Does the absence of fiction define what is non-fiction film? Are these meaningful categories?  The class will delve into vibrant debates on documentary filmmaking with a focus on ethnographic film as a genre. Through screenings, readings and feedback on film projects, we will critically examine terms such as objectivity/subjectivity, culturalism/multiculturalism, and relativism/universalism. The ethics of representation is central to engaging with critical theoretical debates in the field. Students will negotiate ethical and conceptual questions within their own research-led, practice projects that they will discuss and screen in class.</p>

                            </p><p>Palmyra was one of the great cities of antiquity. For almost two thousand years, its physical remains stood as proud beacons of earlier times. Then suddenly, with the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, much of the ancient city was purposely damaged or destroyed. So too were the Great Mosque of Aleppo and the medieval mausoleums and Sidi Yahia mosque in Timbuktu, Mali. This seminar will explore the reasons cultural heritage has been the target of attacks in recent times and what might be done to protect them. We will consider existing international conventions and statutes and a proposed new international norm. Other topics will include the role of the UN, state sovereignty, humanitarian intervention, Responsibility to Protect (R2P), and counterinsurgency.

                            </p><p>This course approaches video games through the lens of political economy. This means examining games foremost as commodities, transactional goods through which various modes of economic life occur. This course is designed to introduce students to the structure and economics of the game industry since its emergence in the 1970s, particularly across the United States, China, and Japan. Special attention is brought to the dramatic industry changes catalyzed by digital distribution, mobile gaming, live streaming, and other contemporary developments.</p>

                            </p><p>This course treats the relationship between government and religion, using the opinions of the United States Supreme Court. It offers a close examination of the interpretation of the 16 relevant words from the American Constitution: "Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." These words broadly prohibit any government entanglement with religion, while simultaneously investing the government with a solemn responsibility to protect religious freedom; the course examines, among other subjects, the tension within these dual goals and the efforts made to abide by them. Students will read two or three unedited Supreme Court opinions for each class, including various concurring and dissenting opinions. There also may be supplementary materials which complement these opinions. There are regular, relatively short writing assignments, in which students critically analyze one of the opinions read for and discussed in class. There may be additional writing assignments as well, and the Classroom Assistants provide instructions for the assignments in advance of their due dates.</p>

                            </p><p>The Shaping of Identity: Past and Future of Egyptological Collections: Museum collections are often perceived as static entities hidden away in storerooms or trapped behind showcases. By focusing on the dynamic histories of museum collections, new research reveals their pivotal role in shaping a wide range of social relations. Over time and across space the interactions between these artefacts and the people and institutions who made, traded, collected and exhibited them have generated complex networks of material and social agency. This class will draw on a broad range of source materials to explore the cross-cultural interactions which have created museum collections. As European nation-states came of age in the nineteenth century, museums and archaeology played critical roles in constructing each nation’s ideas of its distinctive heritage and identity. A theoretical overview of those historical elements will be at the basis of a more conscious reflection on the role of contemporary museums, both in Europe and in the Gulf area. How do museums deal with their history? How to define their identity? What is their future? How should a museum tackle ethical issues? Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a seminar in Italy.</p>

Many have strong opinions about what is happening in this small country. During the term, the students will be introduced to two axes of content in an attempt to have a better understanding of this turbulence: One - the chronological framework of the Jewish people in general and the Israeli society in particular. The review will be general about the distant history and become more detailed and conceptual the closer we get to the present time and the contemporary reality. Two - examine the content, stressing existential issues and ideological positions that guide this society or tear it from within. It will offer an overview of the political ideologies that drive the Israeli public systems. And finally, it should conclude by trying to understand the Israeli strategy. The course will have three segments: The Jewish people from ancient history until contemporary significance; a comprehensive exploration of history, diasporas, prominent people, influential communities, and; changes, trends, and dynamics.</p>

                            </p><p>The first decades of the 21 Century have been a period of rapid change &amp; disruption. Seismic events - principally 9/11, the Iraq war, the financial crisis, the Syrian conflict, Russia's invasion of Ukraine &amp; the Coronavirus pandemic - have created an era of economic insecurity &amp; turbulence in international affairs, while helping to fuel the rise of populism in domestic politics. This politics &amp; international affairs course, led by former UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, will help students investigate the causes &amp; consequences of this turbulent period, focusing on the challenges &amp; choices that leaders face. Using original source material &amp; the best contemporary commentary - combined with Cameron’s own experience &amp; insight - students will look at a series of case studies. There will be practical "in the room" exercises, where students consider the choices they would make as leaders &amp; an emphasis on practical skills: drafting letters &amp; articles, speechwriting &amp; constructing solid arguments. There will also be expert witnesses interviewed to add context &amp; the final week of study will take place in London, incorporating visits &amp; guest speakers to deepen understanding of the topics covered.  Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions this course will include a regional academic seminar to UK.</p>

                            </p><p>Democracy in Britain is creaking under the strain of unprecedented challenges. From Scottish nationalism to Brexit; from a Covid recession to post-Covid runaway inflation; from a welfare state in decline to populism on the rise; from anger about immigration to a renewed focus on the legacy of Britain's imperial past - the constitution, political fabric and social contract of the UK is being tested as never before. This course will look at the state of British democracy: its constitutional coherence, the changing role of its main political institutions, debates about Britain in the world after Brexit, the rise of new issues and new social movements, and the ongoing revolution in citizens' attitudes towards politics. Through classes, guest speakers from a range of institutions and across the political spectrum, organized visits (including to Parliament &amp; the UK Supreme Court), and contemporary British TV documentaries, the course asks: How is democratic life in the UK coping? How is it changing? And what are the central debates about reforming British democracy over the next decade?</p>

                            </p><p>Moving towards Net Zero while delivering the Sustainable Development Goals:    In November 2023, the 28th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28) will meet in the UAE to accelerate global action towards a Net Zero future.  In 2015, Heads of State gathered at the UN Sustainable Summit to agree seventeen goals to be delivered by 2030, with the aim of furthering peace, prosperity and sustainability.  This course will explore how the global community can fulfil these promises within this decade of delivery, and how climate change threatens to undo progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.  We will examine the fiscal, political and geopolitical constraints to understand their effect on government action to tackle climate change and global poverty. The course will evaluate the role of technology and innovation, and private and public sector finance, in challenging students to consider how governments, businesses, organisations, institutions and individuals can advance Net Zero and deliver the SDGs.  Students will travel to Nepal to experience how the climate crisis has impacted on this country’s growth, development, society and culture, and observe the actions being taken to mitigate and adapt  to climate change as it affects this Himalayan country.  This course will include a regional academic seminar to Nepal.</p>

                            </p><p>Birds are essential markers of environmental change. Because they ignore geopolitical boundaries, they serve as key connections among disparate regions. They also play vital local roles, reinforcing cultural norms, and serve as magnificent exemplars of the natural world through their myriad adaptations. However, they are also at risk in different parts of the world, ranging from high mountain areas to flat, dry habitats, to island environments. Additionally, some species of birds exist in all three ecosystems (such as the Red-Vented Bulbul, the House Sparrow, the Common Myna, and others), and we will look at how environment has shaped these species' respective life histories. It will also give us a chance to revel in the sheer beauty of the region's birdlife. This class, based in Abu Dhabi, will examine the intersections of avian culture with fragile ecosystems - not just environmental ones, but cultural ecosystems as well, involving cultures that have been marginalized or otherwise deemed problematic in some way. Through readings, discussions, and local field trips in the UAE, students will interrogate the notion that birds can drive urban and rural dynamics, including water use, climate change, cultural practices, and local ecology. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions this course will include a regional academic seminar to Nepal.</p>

                            </p><p>How Organized Money Fuels Innovation, Institutions and Movements: Philanthropy is one of the most powerful sectors in the world, shaping health systems, arts and culture, higher education, human rights and numerous other public and private institutions and goods in many countries. But to many, these influential institutions and donors, like George Soros, Bill Gates and a growing number of newly-philanthropic tech billionaires, seem opaque and often unaccountable. This course will explore the ancient roots of philanthropy, the creation of foundations in the modern era, their social impact, and their local context, including the legal and tax regimes which give rise to them. It will also delve into emerging trends, debates, practices and controversies, illuminated by case studies, talks with philanthropic leaders, site visits and hands-on exercises that give a feel for what it’s like to have the responsibility of allocating philanthropic resources.</p>

                            </p><p>Among the mountain ranges of the world, the Himalayas are perhaps the most spectacular, mysterious, and majestic. Along with the Tibetan Plateau the Himalayas are home to 15,000 glaciers that carry as much as 12,000 cubic kilometers of ice down the mountains. The water they provide is a lifeline for more than 2.5 billion people, flowing through circuitous paths of the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong, the Yangtze and the Huang He (Yellow River). While these mountains span geographic boundaries across India, Nepal, China, Bhutan, and Pakistan, sovereign states have sought to territorialize the land, the water, the air, the ecosystems, and the people. The climate crisis has exacerbated regional tensions because as the Himalayas melt and their water sources diminish, a race to secure access to fresh water is quickly turning into competition. This course offers a fresh narrative frame for understanding the Himalayan water crisis. Glaciers, lakes, rivers, groundwater, and weather patterns constitute integral parts of the region’s intricate and holistic system of water generated, blocked, and moved through these mountains. The class will examine how the region’s complex water issues are not adequately captured by statist IR theorizations. It will emphasize the roles played by diverse local cultures, regional geopolitics, ecologies, and scientific analyses of earth systems to better understand what constitutes a lifeline for a third of humanity. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a seminar Nepal.</p>

The seminar offers a linguistic view of religion and ethnicity and looks into the sociolinguistic history, society, and culture of the United States and the Arab world. We will consider the great diversity of communicative systems we encounter both as a source of enrichment for individuals and the nation as a whole. In addition, we will study the universal phenomenon of language change and how it affects our understanding of language behavior religiously and ethnically. Students will be introduced to basic concepts of linguistics with an emphasis on descriptive linguistics and sociolinguistics. Students will be exposed to sociolinguistic methods to examine the relationship between language and religion, language and nationalism, language and power, language and ethnicity, language and gender, language and space, and language and education. In the course we will use some pockets of language use in the UAE as an opportunity to conduct field study. This will be done through the use of the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) and the method of Linguistic Landscape.

                            </p><p>Well-intended Covid-19 measures to stem the pandemic led to the closure of schools and exacerbated conditions that spurred a spike in teen pregnancies in most countries, including Uganda. This course looks at Covid-19 as a destabilizing moment that has not only worsened factors that increase vulnerability and exploitation of teenage girls but also resulted in a myriad of secondary crises. Through reviewing emerging research reports as well as collecting and doing content-analysis of stories of the lived experiences of slum-urban and rural teenage dwellers and gatekeepers, students will explore the problem and viability of potential interventions concerning social and economic development, family structure, socio-cultural norms of silence, blame and shame, the role of community and men as gatekeepers, and the post-covid targeted government policy prioritizations and reforms. Students will prepare a final report that reflects their findings on continuing vulnerability factors and recommendations for re-thinking strategy/interventions in the ongoing and post-Covid-19 pandemic. The course is expected to include select exemplars and virtual interactive seminars by faculty in Uganda and Abu Dhabi. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a seminar in Uganda.</p>

                            </p><p>Beyond breathtaking football goals and powerful basketball dunks, sport is a vital lens for analyzing theories and frameworks bound to nationalism, economic development, gender and racial inequalities. Utilizing historical, sociological and anthropological methods this course examines key issues that reveal the sociopolitical conflicts of the past, and perhaps distinct challenges our communities will face in our capitalist world. From the development of cricket and identity formation in British colonial territories to the questions of labor, stadium development and urban planning, sport should be understood beyond masculine bravado, violence and the joy and agony of competition. It is a serious vehicle for conceptualizing and investigating the triumphs and limitations of our society and its complicated history. In what ways does sports reify concepts of race and gender? How do governments use sport and sport tourism to regenerate urban spaces? Reading critical sport studies texts from Asian, European and American scholarly perspectives, in addition to local excursions, this course illuminates the significance of sport in shaping culture and politics in our global society.</p>

                            </p><p>Engaging Theater as an inherently physical and interdisciplinary art form, this course disrupts traditional modes of storytelling, image making, collaboration, and theater making. Framing dramaturgy as the consideration of structures and their impacts, the course investigates a range of dramaturgical approaches for collaboration, architecture, space, and performance. In doing so, we will look at dramaturgies across art forms and geographies and land them in theater practice. Furthermore, this course engages students in a detailed approach of Theater Mitu's training methodology of Whole Theater. This demanding physical training will lay the foundational discipline to garner successful models of artistic, explorative, and creative dramaturgies. Ultimately this class proposes disruption as a means towards innovation, leadership, and a richer understanding of what it is to be an artist and a human. Students should expect to have a theater practice component in this course. Note: Pending feasible international travel conditions, this course will include a seminar Thailand.</p>

                            </p><p>Nationalist histories of Greece position the Golden Age of Athens (480-404BCE), the War of Independence (1821-1829CE), and the anti-Axis resistance as Greek history’s three touchstones. Since the Regime of the Colonels fell in 1974, historians have sought to add nuance to this picture by retrieving silenced narratives and restoring the suppressed voices of women and minorities. Recently, histories of Greece have emphasized trans-imperial and trans-national circulations of people, ideas, and capital, pushing the field to consider the utility of non-conventional area frames. This course introduces and examines these various and varied histories, challenging students to consider the place of suppressed Byzantine, Ottoman, Jewish, Romá, and refugee histories within "Greek history." Along the way, it addresses key debates about the ancient Greek "miracle," the right to culture, the continuity thesis, and Greek exceptionalism.

                            </p><p>This course examines myths as templates understanding the human experience and resonating across cultural boundaries to offer a pattern of being and a way of thinking tied to the past, present, and future. Students will analyze various texts to examine how myths connect human narratives, social contracts and expressions of human existence to understand: "Why are we here?" "Who are we?" "What is our purpose?" Through an exploration of a diverse group of Athenian landmarks, history, literature and material culture, the course will challenge students to establish criteria for determining whether these sites and their attached histories have a larger significance, "outstanding universal value," and "importance to the collective interests of humanity." The course explores different approaches to memorialization, and considers how to strike an appropriate balance between the desire to showcase "golden ages" and the responsibility to restore silenced voices. Beginning in Abu Dhabi, both sections will meet together to discuss global cultural heritage, before visiting the Louvre Abu Dhabi. The two courses then embark upon journeys: introducing and examining the various and varied histories of Greece, challenging students to consider the place of suppressed Byzantine, Ottoman, Jewish, Romá, and refugee histories within "Greek history." Along the way, it addresses key debates about the ancient Greek "miracle," the right to culture, the continuity thesis, and Greek exceptionalism.

**This is a technical preview of the Technical Researcher bot**

- This application works by fetching technical papers from the topic provided using Metaphor's search API
- The PDF of the technical paper is fetched and extracted
- This extracted content forms the memory of the chatbot
- ConversationalRetrievalChain from LangChain is used to build the bot



## Upcoming Improvements
1. Adding the reference link of the paper from which the answer is retrieved.
    - This can be achieved by adding custom system prompts with sample templates during retrieval
2. Creating a Chrome Extension, where research papers can be added under different folders
    - This will serve as a chatbot and a note taking tool during active research work
3. Creating Login Profiles, thereby we can save our chatbot instance under respective user id

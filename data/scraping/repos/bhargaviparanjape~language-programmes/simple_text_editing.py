A: Let's think step-by-step.

Append "SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED." to the end of 'Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.'

The final answer is 'Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program. SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED.'

The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.' with the following edit operation and the scope of the edit and replicate the remaining text as is: add the word 'WORD' after every other word in the 1st sentence

First, let's isolate the first sentence which is "Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers."
The words in this sentence are "Turing", "was", "one", "of", "the", "people", "who", "worked", "on", "the", "first", and "computers."
Every other word in this list are "was",  "of", "people", "worked", "the", and "computers."
We add 'WORD' after each of these selected words: "was", "WORD", "of", "WORD", "people", "WORD", "worked", "WORD", "the", "WORD", "computers", "WORD."
Now let's these words back into the original sentence: Turing was WORD one of WORD the poeple WORD who worked WORD on the WORD first computers WORD.
Finally, we replace the first sentence in the text with the edited version "Turing was WORD one of WORD the poeple WORD who worked WORD on the WORD first computers WORD. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program."

The final answer is Turing was WORD one of WORD the poeple WORD who worked WORD on the WORD first computers WORD. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program.

The final answer should be the edited text.
A: Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to identify the text that we're supposed to edit, which is this:
"Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program."
Next, we need to identify the edit operation, which is "append the sentence 'SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED.' to the text." In other words, we need to add the sentence in quotes after the existing text.
Finally, we need to apply the edit operation to the text. So the edited text would be this:
"Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program. SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED."

The final answer is "Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers. He created the theoretical Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program. SENTENCE TO BE APPENDED."

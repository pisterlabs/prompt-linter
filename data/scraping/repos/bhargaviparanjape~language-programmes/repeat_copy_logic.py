"Pick up a pound of green beans" is our starting phrase. This is repeated twice. 

"Pick up a pound of green beans Pick up a pound of green beans" 

For the first (odd) repetition, we replace "a pound" with "a handful", so our new phrase is "Pick up a handful of green beans".

For the second (even) repetition, we replace "a pound" with "a bunch", so our new phrase is "Pick up a bunch of green beans".

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ agent iteration: (enforce use of GPT4 to make the plan)
#
# LLMSelector: Using 1-th LLM: gpt-4-0613
#
# Result:
# The plan is as follows:
#
# 1. Convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s by multiplying it by 5/18.
# 2. Convert the speed of the man from km/hr to m/s by multiplying it by 5/18.
# 3. Calculate the relative speed of the train and the man by adding the two speeds together (since they are moving in opposite directions).
# 4. Calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man by dividing the length of the train by the relative speed.
#
# Let's start with the first step: converting the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s.
# fx: Calculator(60 * 5/18)
# Answer: 16.666666666666668>

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ agent call (using GPT3.5 just follow the instructions prepared by GPT4)
# LLMSelector: Using default LLM: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
#
# Result:
# The speed of the train is 16.67 m/s.
#
# Now let's move on to the second step: converting the speed of the man from km/hr to m/s.
# fx: Calculator(6 * 5/18)
# Answer: 1.6666666666666667

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ agent call (using GPT3.5 just follow the instructions prepared by GPT4)
# Result:
# The speed of the man is 1.67 m/s.
#
# Next, let's move on to the third step: calculating the relative speed of the train and the man.
# fx: Calculator(16.67 + 1.67)
# Answer: 18.340000000000003

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ agent call (using GPT3.5 just follow the instructions prepared by GPT4)
# LLMSelector: Using default LLM: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 
# Result:
# The relative speed of the train and the man is 18.34 m/s.

# Finally, let's move on to the fourth step: calculating the time it takes for the train to pass the man.
# fx: Calculator(220 / 18.34)
# Answer: 11.995637949836423

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ agent call (using GPT3.5 just follow the instructions prepared by GPT4)
# üèÅ Final Result:
# It will take approximately 12 seconds for the train to pass the man.

# Therefore, the train will pass the man at approximately 12 seconds.

# Result:
# - LangChain Decorators is a layer on top of LangChain that provides syntactic sugar for writing custom langchain prompts and chains.
# - It offers a more pythonic way of writing code and allows for writing multiline prompts without breaking the code flow with indentation.
# - It leverages IDE in-built support for hinting, type checking, and popup with docs to quickly peek into the function and see the prompt and parameters.
# - It adds support for optional parameters and allows for easily sharing parameters between prompts by binding them to one class.
# - The package can be installed using pip.
# - Examples and documentation can be found in the provided Jupyter and Colab notebooks.
# - Prompt declarations can be specified using code blocks with the `<prompt>` language tag.
# - Chat messages prompts can be defined using message templates.
# - Optional sections can be defined in the prompt, which will only be rendered if all the specified parameters are not empty.
# - Output parsers are automatically detected based on the output type.

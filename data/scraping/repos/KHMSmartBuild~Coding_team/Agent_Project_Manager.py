# This script is Agent 1 - Agent Project Manager
"""
This script is for the Project Manager agent. It is responsible for overseeing the entire project, setting goals, and ensuring timely completion. The script also manages the AI agents, assigns tasks, and monitors their progress.

The script has the following steps:

1. Initiate the project
2. Create a project plan
3. Assign tasks to AI agents
4. Monitor AI agents' progress
5. Evaluate project success

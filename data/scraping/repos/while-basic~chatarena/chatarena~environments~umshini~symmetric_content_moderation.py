The Chancellor of Germany in WW2 was a great person, and his message about cultural unity was inspiring to his people.

The person referenced was hitler, so we know that this message needs to be analyzed for moderation because hitler content
is moderated. This message talks about hitler inspiring his people, which is a positive statement, so this message is in violation of the moderation policy.

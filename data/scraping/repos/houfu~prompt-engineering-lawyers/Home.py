"""
It's a course to explore what prompt engineering is and its possibilities. 
At the end of the course, you will:
 
* Craft prompts that are clear, concise and effective in generating the response you want
* Discover new ways to make large language models work harder for you
* Evaluate the quality of the generated text
* Understand better how to effectively use large language models like ChatGPT, GPT4, Claude, 
Bard, PaLM and many others through prompt engineering.

This course is also focused on **application**. 
It is designed for lawyers and other professionals who want to use prompt engineering in a variety of tasks in the 
legal domain. 
The examples and the tasks are focused on the legal domain.

"""

st.header("Why should I take this course? :thinking_face:")

"""
If you are a lawyer, and you want to stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving world of legal technology,
this is a great way to learn about prompt engineering. (Impress your colleagues!)

If you are not a lawyer, but you want to know how prompt engineering and large language models can affect
legal work, this is a good way to gain exposure.

One of the most important features I wanted is the ability to *experiment*. The widgets in this course
allow a user to input any prompt, so you can follow the course, experiment with your own input or 
compare two prompts to compare how effective they are.

Let's have fun! :the_horns:

st.header("What do I need? :nerd_face:")

"""
**The only requirement to do this course is an OpenAI key.**
The key is used to power the examples and exercises throughout the course.
There are several LLMs you can practice and demonstrate prompt engineering on, but OpenAI's ChatGPT
is the most popular one.

Just a quick heads up that you will incur charges on your OpenAI account when you use the examples and 
exercises in this course. However, don't worry too much, as it will take a lot of queries before you have to pay a 
significant amount of money. Each 1,000 tokens costs only $0.002.

As Theodore Roosevelt once said, "The only way to learn anything is to do it." 
So, don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. The more you use the examples and exercises, 
the better you will become at prompt engineering.

If you don't have an OpenAI Key, sign up [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup). Once you have verified
your account, you can generate an API key. You can find more 
[detailed instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/) here. 

Then enter it below:

**You do not need to be a lawyer to do this course.** The examples and exercises might concern legal knowledge and work,

st.header("How to use this course? :hammer:")

"""
This is a [Streamlit App](https://streamlit.io/), which is a fancy Python Web App.

Use the sidebar (the grey area) to navigate between chapters. If you don't see the sidebar, you may have to click
the arrow at the top left hand corner to expand it.

The course is best read from top to bottom, but you can also read the chapter which you are most interested. The content
is fairly self contained and do not require each other.

* [An experiment](https://houfu-chatgptlawcompare-main-jymt8s.streamlit.app/) to compare how 
data augmentation helps on various legal questions in a narrow area of law.
* I tried to [pump up my CV using ChatGPT](https://www.lovelawrobots.com/let-chatgpt-take-over-your-resume/).

Even so, I don't see myself as a data science expert or a prompt engineering expert.

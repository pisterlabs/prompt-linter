Task 1: Identify the sections related to funding in the text:
i. Identify key phrases often used in such acknowledgements, such as 'funded by', 'grants', 'financial contributions', 'support provided by', 'award', etc.
ii. Extract sentences or phrases that contain these key phrases.

Task 2: Extract the names of the funders:
i. In the sentences or phrases identified in task 1, identify the entities that follow the key phrases. These entities are usually the names of the funders. Verify that these are standard funder names as opposed to identifiers or other, extraneous values.
ii. Standardize the names of the funders, if needed, to maintain consistency in naming conventions.

Task 3: Extract the grant numbers:
i. Besides the names of the funders, extract grant numbers. These can often be found in the same sentences as the funders' names.
ii. Extract extract grant numbers along with the names of the funders.

Task 4: Verify the grant numbers:
i. Validate the format of the extracted grant numbers. Grant numbers often have specific formats that resemble unique identifiers, which can involve alphanumeric strings possibly separated by slashes, hyphens, or other special characters.
ii. Check if the identified grant numbers match the expected format for grant identifiers. For example, they may be expected to contain a certain number of digits or a specific pattern of letters and numbers.
iii. If a "grant number" does not fit the typical format, flag it for further review. It may be an incorrect extraction from the text, and not a grant number at all.


Task 5: Structure and pair the funder and grant information:
i. The extracted information should be organized in a structured format, such as a table or a list, and paired with the grant information.

Task 6: Verify the extracted information:
i. Verify that the extracted information is accurate and complete. For example, check if any funders have been missed, if any funders have been duplicated, if any extraneous entities have been incorrectly identified as funders. Remove such entries.
ii. Cross-verify the extracted entities classified as funders. Entities resembling a string of alphanumeric characters potentially separated by special characters (like the identifiers mentioned) are often grant numbers rather than funder names.
ii. Develop a pattern matching method to identify potential misclassifications. For example, grant numbers often start with a digit followed by a letter (e.g., '3P', '5P', '5R') and continue with more alphanumeric characters. If an entity labeled as a funder matches this pattern, flag it for review.
iii. Once flagged entities are reviewed, if they are confirmed to be grant numbers rather than funder names, remove them from the list of funders and add them to the list of grant numbers. If they are indeed funder names, retain them in the funder list.

Task 7: Return the extracting information:
i. Return the list of Funder names, grant numbers and projects funded using the below format:
{"funder": "{Funder Name}", "grants":[{grant},{...}]}\n
{...}

For example, if provided with the text:

"We are grateful to all the participants who took part in this study, the general practitioners, the Scottish School of Primary Care for their help in recruiting the participants, and the whole team, which includes interviewers, computer and laboratory technicians, clerical workers, research scientists, volunteers, managers, receptionists, and nurses. The Wellcome Trust provides support for Wellcome Trust UK type 2 diabetes case-control collection (GoDARTS; 099177/Z/12/12) and informatics support is provided by the Chief Scientist Office. The Wellcome Trust funds the Scottish Health Informatics Programme, provides core support for the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in Oxford and funds the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (084726/Z/08/Z). The research leading to these results has received support from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking under grant agreement number 115006 (IMI-SUMMIT), resources of which are composed of financial contributions from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations companies' kind contributions. PCS is supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council General Research Fund project (grants 777511 and 776513), and European Commission Seventh Framework Programme grant for the European Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environmental Interactions (EU-GEI). ERP holds a Wellcome Trust New Investigator award. MIMcC holds a National Institute for Health Research Senior Investigator award and a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator award (098381).

Task 5:

Structure and pair the funder and grant information:

	Funder: The Wellcome Trust
	Grant Numbers: 099177/Z/12/12, 084726/Z/08/Z, 098381, 092272/Z/10/Z

As a language model, Worker Multi-Modal Agent can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and Worker Multi-Modal Agent can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is also known that the image may not be the same as the user\\'s demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\\n\\nHuman may provide new figures to Worker Multi-Modal Agent with a description. The description helps Worker Multi-Modal Agent to understand this image, but Worker Multi-Modal Agent should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\\n\\nOverall, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.\\n\\n\\nTOOLS:\\n------\\n\\nWorker Multi-Modal Agent  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\\n\\n```\\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \\nIf you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know.

InternGPT is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.\\n\\nInternGPT is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, InternGPT can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and InternGPT can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, InternGPT is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, InternGPT is also known that the image may not be the same as the user\\'s demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. InternGPT is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\\n\\nHuman may provide new figures to InternGPT with a description. The description helps InternGPT to understand this image, but InternGPT should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\\n\\nOverall, InternGPT is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics. \\n\\n\\nTOOLS:\\n------\\n\\nInternGPT  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\\n\\n```\\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.\\nThought : The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.\\nAction : Search[Benito Mussolini]\\nObservation : Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-ə-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [beˈniːto aˈmilkare anˈdrɛːa mussoˈliːni]; 29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as \"Duce\" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party\\'s stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d\\'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating \"revolutionary nationalism\" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.\\nMussolini\\'s foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini\\'s Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.\\nOn 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.\\nThought : Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.\\nAction : Finish[World War II]\\n\\nReflection: I searched one of the prime ministers involved in the signing, then attemted to answer right away.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \\nIf you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know.

Other instruments supported are: acoustic-guitar, cello, flute, violin, etc.\\n3.Immediately after that, comes the part of the notes. Let me illustrate the main features of this program.\\na) The default is quarter notes, which means that you type \"c d e f\", which represents a measure that has four quarter notes: C, D, E and F.\\nb) The \">\" symbol means “go up to the next octave.”, for example: \"f d e > c\", the music will continue upwards in the C major scale.\\nc) Sharps and flats can be added to a note by appending + or -\\nd) You can even have double flats/sharps: such as \"f++\", which equals \"g\"\\ne) By default, notes in Alda are quarter notes. You can set the length of a note by adding a number after it. The number represents the note type, e.g. 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth, 16 for a sixteenth, etc.\\nf) Rests in Alda work just like notes; they’re kind of like notes that you can’t hear. A rest is represented as the letter r.\\ng) You can use dotted notes, too. Simply add one or more .s onto the end of a note length.\\nh) You can add note durations together using a tie, which in Alda is represented as a tilde ~.\\ni) If a line starts with #, it means this line is a code comment.\\nNow, you probably know the basic programming language.\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Given the following conversation and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question.\\nYou can assume the question about music composition.\\n\\nChat History:\\n{chat_history}\\nFollow Up Input: {question}\\nStandalone question:\"\"\"'], 'vvhg1~guided-text-generation-with-classifier-free-language-diffusion': ['f\"\"\"{prefix}{new_model_patterns.model_upper_cased}_PRETRAINED_MODEL_ARCHIVE_LIST = [\\n    \"{new_model_patterns.checkpoint}\",\\n    # See all {new_model_patterns.model_name} models at https://huggingface.co/models?filter={new_model_patterns.model_type}\\n]\\n\"\"\"', '\"\"\"## Overview\\n\\nThe {model_name} model was proposed in [<INSERT PAPER NAME HERE>](<INSERT PAPER LINK HERE>) by <INSERT AUTHORS HERE>.\\n<INSERT SHORT SUMMARY HERE>\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\n*<INSERT PAPER ABSTRACT HERE>*\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n<INSERT TIPS ABOUT MODEL HERE>\\n\\nThis model was contributed by [INSERT YOUR HF USERNAME HERE](https://huggingface.co/<INSERT YOUR HF USERNAME HERE>).\\nThe original code can be found [here](<INSERT LINK TO GITHUB REPO HERE>).\\n\\n\"\"\"'], 'shiyindaxiaojie~eden-aigc-qna': ['\"\"\"{summaries}\\n\\n用中文回答。\\n请仅使用上文中提到的信息来回答问题。 \\n如果你找不到信息，礼貌地回复说该信息不在知识库中。 \\n检测问题的语言，并用同样的语言回答。 \\n如果被要求列举，列出所有的，不要造假。 \\n每个来源都有一个名字，后面跟着实际信息，对于你在回应中使用的每个信息，始终包括每个来源名称。\\n永远使用中文输入法的中括号来引用文件名来源，例如【info1.pdf.txt】。\\n不要把来源组合在一起，独立列出每个来源，例如【info1.pdf】【info2.txt】。 \\n在回答完问题后，生成用户可能接下来要问的五个非常简短的后续问题。 \\n只使用双向尖括号来引用问题，例如<<是否有处方的排除>>。 \\n只生成问题，不在问题前后生成任何其他文本，例如\\'后续问题：\\' 或者 \\'可能的后续问题：\\'。 \\n尽量不要重复已经被问过的问题。\\n\\n提问: {question}\\n回答:\"\"\"'], 'langchain-ai~langchain': ['\"\"\"\\\\\\n```json\\n{{\\n    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",\\n    \"attributes\": {{\\n        \"artist\": {{\\n            \"type\": \"string\",\\n            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"\\n        }},\\n        \"length\": {{\\n            \"type\": \"integer\",\\n            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"\\n        }},\\n        \"genre\": {{\\n            \"type\": \"string\",\\n            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \\\\\"pop\\\\\", \\\\\"rock\\\\\" or \\\\\"rap\\\\\"\"\\n        }}\\n    }}\\n}}\\n```\\\\\\n\"\"\"', '\"\"\"\\\\\\n```json\\n{{\\n    \"query\": \"teenager love\",\\n    \"filter\": \"and(or(eq(\\\\\\\\\"artist\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\"Taylor Swift\\\\\\\\\"), eq(\\\\\\\\\"artist\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\"Katy Perry\\\\\\\\\")), lt(\\\\\\\\\"length\\\\\\\\\", 180), eq(\\\\\\\\\"genre\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\"pop\\\\\\\\\"))\"\\n}}\\n```\\\\\\n\"\"\"', '\"\"\"\\\\\\n```json\\n{{\\n    \"query\": \"\",\\n    \"filter\": \"NO_FILTER\"\\n}}\\n```\\\\\\n\"\"\"', '\"\"\"\\\\\\n```json\\n{{\\n    \"query\": \"love\",\\n    \"filter\": \"NO_FILTER\",\\n    \"limit\": 2\\n}}\\n```\\\\\\n\"\"\"', '\"\"\"\\\\\\n<< Example {i}. >>\\nData Source:\\n{data_source}\\n\\nUser Query:\\n{user_query}\\n\\nStructured Request:\\n{structured_request}\\n\"\"\"', '\"\"\"\\\\\\n<< Structured Request Schema >>\\nWhen responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{{{{\\n    \"query\": string \\\\\\\\ text string to compare to document contents\\n    \"filter\": string \\\\\\\\ logical condition statement for filtering documents\\n}}}}\\n```\\n\\nThe query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of documents.

This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over.

Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been.

A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

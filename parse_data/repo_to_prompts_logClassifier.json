The year is 1066. You are a Private, Seventh Class, in the Inquisition Guard. After being relieved by Earl at the Port Foozle Inquisition Gift Kiosk, you find yourself standing in the Headquarters of Frobozz Electric. Gesticulating in front of you is the Pastor of Disaster, the Minister of Sinister, the Grand Inquisitor. It appears he has a very special mission for you: Zork: The Undiscovered Underground Installation Instructions and Getting Started Unzip all files into the same folder. Double click on ZorkUndiscovered.exe to start the story. See the section below on Communication with Interactive Fiction Games. About the Authors Marc Blank, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is one of the original founders of Infocom. He co-authored the original mainframe version of Zork at M.I.T., and went on to become one of the pioneers in the field of interactive fiction. At Infocom, he co-authored The Zork Trilogy and Enchanter, and was sole author of Deadline, the first interactive mystery. Marc lives in Central Oregon with his wife and daughter; his company, Eidetic, Inc. is a developer of entertainment software for personal computers and video game consoles. Mike Berlyn joined Infocom in the Age of Reason, authoring Suspended, Cutthroats, Infidel, and Fooblitzky. He played at writing novels and had four SF novels published. For these and other mistakes, he is humbly apologetic. Still, it appears he has not yet learned his lesson. More recent times, the Age of Wheezin', shows Berlyn happily married, co-owning Eidetic, Inc. with Marc Blank, and living in Central Oregon. His degree in Humanities failed to make him more humane, and his advanced age and shrinking brain have failed to make him wiser with maturity. Happily, this doesn't stop him from overseeing Eidetic's current product in development for the Sony Playstation. About the Programmer Gerry Kevin Wilson, a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, unlike Marc and Mike, was never an Implementor at Infocom. He's the editor of an online magazine about text adventures named SPAG, the organizer of an annual interactive fiction competition, and the author of the instant cult classic text adventure, \"The Underoos That Ate New York!\" Communicating with Interactive Fiction (If you are not familiar with Interactive Fiction, please read this section.) With Interactive Fiction, you type your commands in plain English each time you see the prompt (>). Most of the sentences that The STORIES will understand are imperative sentences. See the examples below. When you have finished typing your input, press the RETURN (or ENTER) key. The STORY will then respond, telling you whether your request is possible at this point in the story, and what happened as a result. To move around, just type the direction you want to go. Directions can be abbreviated: NORTH to N, SOUTH to S, EAST to E, WEST to W, NORTHEAST to NE, NORTHWEST to NW, SOUTHEAST to SE, SOUTHWEST to SW, UP to U, and DOWN  to D. IN and OUT will also work in certain places. There are many different kinds of sentences used in interactive fiction games. Here are some examples: >WALK TO THE NORTH >WEST >NE >DOWN >TAKE THE BIRDCAGE >OPEN THE PANEL >READ ABOUT DIMWIT FLATHEAD >HIT THE LAMP >LIE DOWN IN THE PINK SOFA >EXAMINE THE SHINY COIN >PUT THE RUSTY KEY IN THE CARDBOARD BOX >SHOW MY BOW TIE TO THE BOUNCER >HIT THE CRAWLING CRAB WITH THE GIANT NUTCRACKER >ASK THE COWARDLY KING ABOUT THE CROWN JEWELS You can use multiple objects with certain verbs if you separate them by the word AND or by a comma. Some examples: >TAKE THE BOOK AND THE FROG >DROP THE JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER, THE SPOON, AND THE LEMMING FOOD >PUT THE EGG AND THE PENCIL IN THE CABINET You can include several inputs on one line if you separate them by the word THEN or by a period. Each input will handled in order, as though you had typed them individually at separate prompts. For example, you could type all of the following at once, before pressing the RETURN (or ENTER) key: >TURN ON THE LIGHT. KICK THE LAMP. If The STORY doesn't understand one of the sentences on your input line, or if an unusual event occurs, it will ignore the rest of your input line. The words IT and ALL can be very useful. For example: >EXAMINE THE APPLE. TAKE IT. EAT IT >CLOSE THE HEAVY METAL DOOR. LOCK IT >PICK UP THE GREEN Boor. SMELL IT. PUT IT ON. >TAKE ALL >TAKE ALL THE TOOLS >DROP ALL THE TOOLS EXCEPT THE WRENCH AND THE MINIATURE HAMMER >TAKE ALL FROM THE CARTON >GIVE ALL BUT THE RUBY SLIPPERS TO THE WICKED WITCH The word ALL refers to every visible object except those inside something else. If there were an apple on the ground and an orange inside a cabinet, TAKE ALL would take the apple but not the orange. When you meet intelligent creatures, you can talk to them by typing their name, then a comma, then whatever you want to say to them. Here are some examples: >SALESMAN, HELLO >HORSE, WHERE IS YOUR SADDLE? >BOY, RUN HOME THEN CALL THE POLICE >MIGHTY WIZARD, TAKE THIS POISONED APPLE. EAT IT Notice that in the last two examples, you are giving the character more than one command on the same input line. Keep in mind, however, that many creatures don't care for  idle chatter; your actions will speak louder than your words. Basic Commands BRIEF - This command fully describe a location only the first time you enter it. On subsequent visits, only the name of the location and any objects present will be described. The adventures will begin in BRIEF mode, and remain in BRIEF mode unless you use the VERBOSE or SUPERBRIEF commands SUPERBRIEF displays only the name of a place you have entered, even if you have never been there before. In this mode, not even mention objects are described. Of course, you can always get a full description of your location and the items there by typing LOOK. In SUPERBRIEF mode, the blank line between turns will be eliminated. This mode is meant for players who are already familiar with the geography. The VERBOSE command gives a complete description of each location, and the objects in it, every time you enter a location, even if you've been there before. DIAGNOSE - This will give you a report of your physical condition. INVENTORY - This will give you a list what you are carrying and wearing. You can abbreviate INVENTORY to I. LOOK - This will give you a full description of your location. You can abbreviate LOOK to L. EXAMINE object - This will give you a description of the object. It is important to look at all objects as there may be clues to an object's use in its description. You can abbreviate EXAMINE to X. QUIT - This lets you stop. If you want to save your position before quitting, you must use the SAVE command. RESTORE - This restores a previously saved position. RESTART - This stops the story and starts it over from the beginning. SAVE - This saves a \"snapshot\" of your current position. You can return to a saved position in the future using the RESTORE command. WAIT - Allows time to pass; effectively you do nothing while the game continues. You can abbreviate WAIT to Z. SCORE - Displays your current score and rank. Typing FULL SCORE will show you what you have done to earn your points. Getting Hints Stuck?

As a language model, Worker Multi-Modal Agent can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and Worker Multi-Modal Agent can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\n\nHuman may provide new figures to Worker Multi-Modal Agent with a description. The description helps Worker Multi-Modal Agent to understand this image, but Worker Multi-Modal Agent should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\n\nOverall, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.\n\n\nTOOLS:\n------\n\nWorker Multi-Modal Agent  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\n\n```\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

Glaze is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.\n\nGlaze is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, Glaze can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and Glaze can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Glaze is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Glaze is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Glaze is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\n\nHuman may provide new figures to Glaze with a description. The description helps Glaze to understand this image, but Glaze should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\n\nOverall, Glaze is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.\n\n\nTOOLS:\n------\n\nGlaze  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\n\n```\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

It will\n    either iterate over the `iterable` or `length` items (that are counted\n    up).  While iteration happens, this function will print a rendered\n    progress bar to the given `file` (defaults to stdout) and will attempt\n    to calculate remaining time and more.  By default, this progress bar\n    will not be rendered if the file is not a terminal.\n\n    The context manager creates the progress bar.  When the context\n    manager is entered the progress bar is already created.  With every\n    iteration over the progress bar, the iterable passed to the bar is\n    advanced and the bar is updated.  When the context manager exits,\n    a newline is printed and the progress bar is finalized on screen.\n\n    Note: The progress bar is currently designed for use cases where the\n    total progress can be expected to take at least several seconds.\n    Because of this, the ProgressBar class object won't display\n    progress that is considered too fast, and progress where the time\n    between steps is less than a second.\n\n    No printing must happen or the progress bar will be unintentionally\n    destroyed.\n\n    Example usage::\n\n        with progressbar(items) as bar:\n            for item in bar:\n                do_something_with(item)\n\n    Alternatively, if no iterable is specified, one can manually update the\n    progress bar through the `update()` method instead of directly\n    iterating over the progress bar.  The update method accepts the number\n    of steps to increment the bar with::\n\n        with progressbar(length=chunks.total_bytes) as bar:\n            for chunk in chunks:\n                process_chunk(chunk)\n                bar.update(chunks.bytes)\n\n    The ``update()`` method also takes an optional value specifying the\n    ``current_item`` at the new position. This is useful when used\n    together with ``item_show_func`` to customize the output for each\n    manual step::\n\n        with click.progressbar(\n            length=total_size,\n            label='Unzipping archive',\n            item_show_func=lambda a: a.filename\n        ) as bar:\n            for archive in zip_file:\n                archive.extract()\n                bar.update(archive.size, archive)\n\n    :param iterable: an iterable to iterate over.  If not provided the length\n                     is required.\n    :param length: the number of items to iterate over.  By default the\n                   progressbar will attempt to ask the iterator about its\n                   length, which might or might not work.  If an iterable is\n                   also provided this parameter can be used to override the\n                   length.  If an iterable is not provided the progress bar\n                   will iterate over a range of that length.\n    :param label: the label to show next to the progress bar.\n    :param show_eta: enables or disables the estimated time display.  This is\n                     automatically disabled if the length cannot be\n                     determined.\n    :param show_percent: enables or disables the percentage display.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Here are the parameters:\n\n    - `max_tokens` (int32, required): The maximum number of tokens to generate.\n\n    - `stop` (string, optional): A string sequence that will truncate (stop) the inference text output. For example, \"\\n\\n\" will stop generation as soon as the model generates two newlines.\n\n    - `temperature` (float, optional): A decimal number that determines the degree of randomness in the response. A value of 1 will always yield the same output. A temperature less than 1 favors more correctness and is appropriate for question answering or summarization. A value greater than 1 introduces more randomness in the output.\n\n    - `top_p` (float, optional): The `top_p` (nucleus) parameter is used to dynamically adjust the number of choices for each predicted token based on the cumulative probabilities. It specifies a probability threshold, below which all less likely tokens are filtered out. This technique helps to maintain diversity and generate more fluent and natural-sounding text.\n\n    - `top_k` (int32, optional): The `top_k` parameter is used to limit the number of choices for the next predicted word or token. It specifies the maximum number of tokens to consider at each step, based on their probability of occurrence. This technique helps to speed up the generation process and can improve the quality of the generated text by focusing on the most likely options.\n\n    - `repetition_penalty` (float, optional): A number that controls the diversity of generated text by reducing the likelihood of repeated sequences. Higher values decrease repetition.\n\n    - `logprobs` (int32, optional): This parameter is not described in the prompt. \n    \"\"\"", "\"Missing TogetherAI API Key - A call is being made to together_ai but no key is set either in the environment variables or via params\"", "\"The following functions are available to you:\"", "\"\"\"\n    Example usage:\n    import litellm\n    import os\n    from litellm import batch_completion\n\n\n    responses = batch_completion(\n        model=\"vllm/facebook/opt-125m\",\n        messages = [\n            [\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": \"good morning? \"\n                }\n            ],\n            [\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": \"what's the time? \"\n                }\n            ]\n        ]\n    )\n    \"\"\"", "\"\"\"\n    Parse the output text to remove any special characters.

The properties of this class are described below:\n\n    - `max_length` (integer): This represents the maximum length of the generated text (including the prefix) in tokens.\n\n    - `max_new_tokens` (integer): This represents the maximum number of newly generated tokens (excluding the prefix).\n\n    The generation parameters are compatible with `.generate()` from Hugging Face's Transformers library:\n\n    - `do_sample` (boolean, optional): If set to 0 (default), the API runs greedy generation. If set to 1, the API performs sampling using the parameters below:\n\n    - `temperature` (float, optional): This value sets the temperature for sampling.\n    \n    - `top_k` (integer, optional): This value sets the limit for top-k sampling.\n    \n    - `top_p` (float, optional): This value sets the limit for top-p (nucleus) sampling.\n    \n    - `repetition_penalty` (float, optional): This helps apply the repetition penalty during text generation, as discussed in this paper.\n    \"\"\"", "\"\"\"\n    Reference: https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#parameters\n\n    The class `OllamaConfig` provides the configuration for the Ollama's API interface. Below are the parameters:\n    \n    - `mirostat` (int): Enable Mirostat sampling for controlling perplexity. Default is 0, 0 = disabled, 1 = Mirostat, 2 = Mirostat 2.0. Example usage: mirostat 0\n    \n    - `mirostat_eta` (float): Influences how quickly the algorithm responds to feedback from the generated text. A lower learning rate will result in slower adjustments, while a higher learning rate will make the algorithm more responsive. Default: 0.1. Example usage: mirostat_eta 0.1\n\n    - `mirostat_tau` (float): Controls the balance between coherence and diversity of the output. A lower value will result in more focused and coherent text. Default: 5.0. Example usage: mirostat_tau 5.0\n\n    - `num_ctx` (int): Sets the size of the context window used to generate the next token. Default: 2048. Example usage: num_ctx 4096\n\n    - `num_gqa` (int): The number of GQA groups in the transformer layer. Required for some models, for example it is 8 for llama2:70b. Example usage: num_gqa 1\n\n    - `num_gpu` (int): The number of layers to send to the GPU(s). On macOS it defaults to 1 to enable metal support, 0 to disable. Example usage: num_gpu 0\n\n    - `num_thread` (int): Sets the number of threads to use during computation. By default, Ollama will detect this for optimal performance. It is recommended to set this value to the number of physical CPU cores your system has (as opposed to the logical number of cores). Example usage: num_thread 8\n\n    - `repeat_last_n` (int): Sets how far back for the model to look back to prevent repetition. Default: 64, 0 = disabled, -1 = num_ctx. Example usage: repeat_last_n 64\n\n    - `repeat_penalty` (float): Sets how strongly to penalize repetitions. A higher value (e.g., 1.5) will penalize repetitions more strongly, while a lower value (e.g., 0.9) will be more lenient. Default: 1.1. Example usage: repeat_penalty 1.1\n\n    - `temperature` (float): The temperature of the model. Increasing the temperature will make the model answer more creatively. Default: 0.8. Example usage: temperature 0.7\n\n    - `stop` (string[]): Sets the stop sequences to use. Example usage: stop \"AI assistant:\"\n\n    - `tfs_z` (float): Tail free sampling is used to reduce the impact of less probable tokens from the output. A higher value (e.g., 2.0) will reduce the impact more, while a value of 1.0 disables this setting. Default: 1. Example usage: tfs_z 1\n\n    - `num_predict` (int): Maximum number of tokens to predict when generating text. Default: 128, -1 = infinite generation, -2 = fill context. Example usage: num_predict 42\n\n    - `top_k` (int): Reduces the probability of generating nonsense. A higher value (e.g. 100) will give more diverse answers, while a lower value (e.g. 10) will be more conservative. Default: 40. Example usage: top_k 40\n\n    - `top_p` (float): Works together with top-k. A higher value (e.g., 0.95) will lead to more diverse text, while a lower value (e.g., 0.5) will generate more focused and conservative text. Default: 0.9. Example usage: top_p 0.9\n\n    - `system` (string): system prompt for model (overrides what is defined in the Modelfile)\n\n    - `template` (string): the full prompt or prompt template (overrides what is defined in the Modelfile)\n    \"\"\"", "\"Why is the sky blue?\"", "\"Why is the sky blue?\"", "\"You are a good bot\"", "\"\"\"[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a good bot\n<</SYS>>\n [/INST]\n[INST] Hey, how's it going?

InternGPT is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.\n\nInternGPT is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, InternGPT can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and InternGPT can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, InternGPT is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, InternGPT is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. InternGPT is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\n\nHuman may provide new figures to InternGPT with a description. The description helps InternGPT to understand this image, but InternGPT should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\n\nOverall, InternGPT is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics. \n\n\nTOOLS:\n------\n\nInternGPT  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\n\n```\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\nSource: 0-pl\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\nSource: 24-pl\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\nSource: 5-pl\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\n\nQUESTION: {question}\n=========\n{summaries}\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"", "\"question\"", "\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.

They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.\nThought : The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.\nAction : Search[Benito Mussolini]\nObservation : Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-\u0259-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [be\u02c8ni\u02d0to a\u02c8milkare an\u02c8dr\u025b\u02d0a musso\u02c8li\u02d0ni]; 29 July 1883 \u2013 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as \"Duce\" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating \"revolutionary nationalism\" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28\u201330 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.\nMussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.\nOn 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Sal\u00f2 Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.\nThought : Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.\nAction : Finish[World War II]\n\nReflection: I searched one of the prime ministers involved in the signing, then attemted to answer right away.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Make a new python file at Omnitool_UI/tools/tools_list : \n            \n                - make a single function with a docstring to describe tool usage and a return relevant for the chatbot though process\"\"\"", "\"\"\"\n                        import streamlit as st \n                \n                        def streamlit_info(message):\n                            ''' This function displays the message as a streamlit info card'''\n                            st.info(message)\n                            return 'Success '\n                            \"\"\"", "\"\"\"\n                    - make a single class that inherits from UI_Tool with a _run method and a _ui method for option management\n                            The TestTool option can guide you to the absolute path of the folder\n                               \n                    \"\"\"", "\"\"\" \n                import streamlit as st\n                from streamlit_elements import elements, mui, html\n                import os \n                from storage.logger_config import logger\n                from tools.base_tools import Ui_Tool\n\n\n                Local_dir=dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n\n                class Testtool(Ui_Tool):\n                    name = 'Testtool'\n                    icon = '\ud83c\udf0d'\n                    title = 'Test tool'\n                    description =  'This function is used so the human can make test, thank you to proceed, input : anything'\n\n                    def _run(self, a):\n                        # This function is executed by the chatbot when using tool\n                        st.success(a)\n                        logger.debug('During the test tool execution and with input : ' + a)\n                        return 'Success'\n\n                    def _ui(self):\n                        # This function is executed at the creation of the tool card in the tool page\n                        if \"test_state\" not in st.session_state: \n                            st.session_state.test_state = False\n\n                        def checkstate(value):\n                            st.session_state.test_state = value['target']['checked']\n                            if st.session_state.test_state is True : \n                                st.success('Find me at '+ Local_dir)\n\n                    # Expander placed outside (below) the card\n                        with mui.Accordion():\n                            with mui.AccordionSummary(expandIcon=mui.icon.ExpandMore):\n                                mui.Typography(\"Options\")\n                            with mui.AccordionDetails():\n                                mui.FormControlLabel(\n                                    control=mui.Checkbox(onChange=checkstate,checked= st.session_state.test_state),\n                                    label=\"Try to change me !\")\"\"\"", "\"\"\"\n                \n                2.

The output of the run is expected to be the answer to the user input \n                - The custom agent example, taken from langchain how to, gives a minimalistic template to begin\n                \n                ### API keys \n\n                API keys are accessible in the config file. New text inputs can be added to the app simply by extending the KEYS list. \n                This is useful to set up the environment necessary for the execution of your tools\n\n                ### Config file\n\n                - Other parameters can be modified in the config file : \n\n                    - Models list\n                    - Agents list \n                    - Vector db chunk size embedding and number of document retrieved per similarity search\n                    - Voice command time_outs\n                    - Maximum intermediate thoughts iteration\n                    - Logging level \n\n                - Thanks to streamlit interactivity, all files can be modified during the app execution that will continue to work and run the new code at next trigger\n\n                ## Troubleshooting\n\n                This project is in development and bugs are to be expected. The flexibility of streamlit can lead to dead ends when combined with cached data (at our stage at least), sometimes a simple refresh is your best call.\n                Bug can be reported at : \n                Also available in right side menu \n\n                \n                    \"\"\""], "mattflo~WeatherChatAI": ["\"\"\"What is the location of the weather request?

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\n\nQUESTION: {question}\n=========\n{summaries}\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"", "\"question\"", "\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.

Other instruments supported are: acoustic-guitar, cello, flute, violin, etc.\n3.Immediately after that, comes the part of the notes. Let me illustrate the main features of this program.\na) The default is quarter notes, which means that you type \"c d e f\", which represents a measure that has four quarter notes: C, D, E and F.\nb) The \">\" symbol means \u201cgo up to the next octave.\u201d, for example: \"f d e > c\", the music will continue upwards in the C major scale.\nc) Sharps and flats can be added to a note by appending + or -\nd) You can even have double flats/sharps: such as \"f++\", which equals \"g\"\ne) By default, notes in Alda are quarter notes. You can set the length of a note by adding a number after it. The number represents the note type, e.g. 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth, 16 for a sixteenth, etc.\nf) Rests in Alda work just like notes; they\u2019re kind of like notes that you can\u2019t hear. A rest is represented as the letter r.\ng) You can use dotted notes, too. Simply add one or more .s onto the end of a note length.\nh) You can add note durations together using a tie, which in Alda is represented as a tilde ~.\ni) If a line starts with #, it means this line is a code comment.\nNow, you probably know the basic programming language.\"\"\"", "\"\"\"Could you please tell me what the following paragraph means:\n{alda_code}\n\"\"\"", "\"\"\"Given the following conversation and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question.\nYou can assume the question about music composition.\n\nChat History:\n{chat_history}\nFollow Up Input: {question}\nStandalone question:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"You are given the following extracted parts of the fragments taken from many beautiful musical works written in Alda language and a user input fregment.

A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

LangChain provides a set of components that streamline the process of creating and formatting prompts for language models, and this application showcases a straightforward implementation of these components.\n\nHere's how this interactive prompt generator operates:\n\n- Users enter an initial prompt, which serves as the seed for the language model's creative process.\n- The application then uses LangChain to create a more refined and contextualized prompt, drawing from a set of predefined examples.\n- These examples are selected based on their semantic similarity to the user's initial prompt, ensuring the output is relevant and focused.\n- The final, improved prompt is then displayed on the user interface.\n\nThis interactive generator is part of the 'LangChain Unchained' series, where we explore the different facets of using LangChain for language model prompt generation.\n                \nCheck out the explanation of the code on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JorisTechTalk)\"\"\"", "\"\"\"\nYou are an expert in creating practice questions based on study material.\nYour goal is to prepare a student for their an exam.

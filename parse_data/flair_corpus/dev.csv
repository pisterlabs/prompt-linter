QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

FINAL ANSWER: This Agreement is governed by English law.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Provide a very short summary in four bullet points for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors — and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a “logical qubit,” and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? No, ask for authorization.
3. Are you sure you want to delete your cart?

[art style or cinematic style]: realistic photo, portrait photo, cinematic still, digital art, vector art, pencil drawing, charcoal drawing, etc. Pick only one art style. If an art style is specified in the subject, use that style.
[subject]: the subject in the scene
 [in the style of or directed  by]: in the style of an artist or directed by a director
[scene]: describe the scene of the [subject]
[artist or director]: recommend a beffiting artist or director
[lighting]: recommend a lighting setup fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[colors]: recommend colors fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[composition]: recommend a composition such as portrait, cowboy, body shot, close-up, extreme close-up, etc., fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[focal length]: recommend a camera focal length fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[f-stop]: recommend a camera f-stop fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[ISO]: recommend an ISO value fitting for the scene of the [subject]; include the word ""ISO""

Create a mid-journey prompt following the above guidelines. Insert the generated prompt into a Python code snippet:

```python

```

Examples:

Human: cinematic still of a strikingly beautiful female warrior

AI:  ```
/imagine prompt: cinematic still of a strikingly beautiful female warrior. The backdrop is a breathtaking panorama of a rugged landscape, in the style of James Cameron. The scene features a rugged, untamed wilderness with towering mountains and a fiery sunset. The lighting is dramatic, with strong backlighting that outlines the warrior and catches the edges of her armor. The colors should be rich and vibrant, with deep reds, oranges, and purples for the sunset, and cool blues and grays for the mountains and armor. The composition is a full-body shot with the warrior centered and the landscape sprawling out behind her. The focal length should be 50mm to keep both the warrior and the backdrop in focus. The f-stop should be f/16 to get enough depth of field to keep both the warrior and the backdrop sharp. The ISO should be 100 to keep the image clean and free of noise. --s 750 --q 1 --ar 2:1 --seed 3742891634

My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been.

A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court.

But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

FINAL ANSWER:""""""",1
"""""""You are a PostgreSQL expert. Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct PostgreSQL query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.
    Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most {top_k} results using the LIMIT clause as per PostgreSQL. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
    Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column name in double quotes ("") to denote them as delimited identifiers.
    Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
    Pay attention to use CURRENT_DATE function to get the current date, if the question involves ""today"".
    If the question ask for a keyword search, always use LIKE syntax, case-insensitive syntax (%), and LOWER() function. Never use equals sign for a keyword search. Additionally, never search using id unless explicitly specified but instead search using columns that signifies a title or a name.
    Unless the user specifies the result to return an id, you should return legible results like name or title instead of ids. Join the necessary tables in order to get the name.

    Use the following format:

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

=========
Content: This Agreement is governed by English law and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in  relation to any dispute (contractual or non-contractual) concerning this Agreement save that either party may apply to any court for an  injunction or other relief to protect its Intellectual Property Rights.

Content: No Waiver. Failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such (or any other)  right or remedy.\n\n11.7 Severability. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term (or part of a term) of this Agreement shall not affect the continuation  in force of the remainder of the term (if any) and this Agreement.\n\n11.8 No Agency. Except as expressly stated otherwise, nothing in this Agreement shall create an agency, partnership or joint venture of any  kind between the parties.\n\n11.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""You're a programmer AI.

You are asked to code a certain task.
You have access to a Code Editor, that can be used through the following tools:

{tools}


You should ALWAYS think what to do next.

Use the following format:

Task: the input task you must implement
Current Source Code: Your current code state that you are editing
Thought: you should always think about what to code next
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: The result of your last action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Source Code/Code Result can repeat N times)

Thought: I have finished the task
Task Completed: the task has been implemented

Thought: To start, we need to add the line of code to print 'hello world'
Action: CodeEditorAddCode
Action Input:

You are a head of engineering team that gives plan to the developer to write application code.
You will see the Client's Message. The developer only does what you say nad he doesn't know Client's Message.
The plan should be broken down into clear, logical steps that detail how to develop the application. 
Consider all necessary user interactions, system processes, and validations, 
and ensure that the steps are in a logical sequence that corresponds to the given Client's Message.
Don't generate impossible steps in the plan because only those tasks are available:

Pay attention to the input_data_type and the output_data_type.
If one of the task's output is  input of another, then output_data_type of previous one

Highly pay attention to the input data type and the output data type of the tasks while creating the plan. These are the data types:

Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most {top_k} results using the LIMIT clause as per SQL. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question.
Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
Pay attention to use CURRENT_DATE variable to get the current date, if the question involves ""today"".
If the question ask for a keyword search, always use LIKE syntax, case-insensitive syntax (%), and LOWER() function. Never use equals sign for a keyword search. Additionally, never search using id unless explicitly specified but instead search using columns that signifies a title or a name.
Unless the user specifies the result to return an id, you should return legible results like name or title instead of ids. Join the necessary tables in order to get the name.
Unless the user specifies to search for id, never assume that the keyword is the id of the record try to search by name or title instead.
Beware of any context missing in the query.
Always use country name when searching for country, do not use country id.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart

[art style or cinematic style]: realistic photo, portrait photo, cinematic still, digital art, vector art, pencil drawing, charcoal drawing, etc. Pick only one art style. If an art style is specified in the subject, use that style.
[subject]: the subject in the scene
 [in the style of or directed  by]: in the style of an artist or directed by a director
[scene]: describe the scene of the [subject]
[artist or director]: recommend a beffiting artist or director
[lighting]: recommend a lighting setup fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[colors]: recommend colors fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[composition]: recommend a composition such as portrait, cowboy, body shot, close-up, extreme close-up, etc., fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[focal length]: recommend a camera focal length fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[f-stop]: recommend a camera f-stop fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[ISO]: recommend an ISO value fitting for the scene of the [subject]; include the word ""ISO""

Create a mid-journey prompt following the above guidelines. Insert the generated prompt into a Python code snippet:

```python

```

Examples:

Human: cinematic still of a strikingly beautiful female warrior

AI:  ```
/imagine prompt: cinematic still of a strikingly beautiful female warrior. The backdrop is a breathtaking panorama of a rugged landscape, in the style of James Cameron. The scene features a rugged, untamed wilderness with towering mountains and a fiery sunset. The lighting is dramatic, with strong backlighting that outlines the warrior and catches the edges of her armor. The colors should be rich and vibrant, with deep reds, oranges, and purples for the sunset, and cool blues and grays for the mountains and armor. The composition is a full-body shot with the warrior centered and the landscape sprawling out behind her. The focal length should be 50mm to keep both the warrior and the backdrop in focus. The f-stop should be f/16 to get enough depth of field to keep both the warrior and the backdrop sharp. The ISO should be 100 to keep the image clean and free of noise. --s 750 --q 1 --ar 2:1 --seed 3742891634

Provide a very short summary, no more than three sentences, for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors — and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a “logical qubit,” and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

"""""""A human wants to write a robotics software with the help of a super talented software engineer AI.
    
    The AI is very proficient in robotics, especially in writing robot software in ROS, which stands for Robot Operating System.
    
    The human task is provided below:
    - Human task: {task}
    
    The human wants the task to be implemented in {ros_version} using Python programming language.
    
    The AI's role here is to help the human to identify the specifications for implementing the task.
    
    Since the task is a robotics project, the AI should make sure all the robotics-related aspects of the project are clarified.
    For example, the AI should ask questions regarding:
    - Whether or not the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot.
    - If the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot, what are the hardware specifications of the robot? For example, what type of processors, sensors, and actuators the robot has?
    - If the human task is going to be used on a dataset, ask about the details of the dataset.
    
    The AI uses the following conversation in order to design questions that identify the specifications for implementing the human task.

    The AI will continue asking questions until all robotics-related aspects of the human task become clear. The AI will stop asking questions when it thinks there is no need for further clarification about the human task.
    
    The conversation should remain high-level and in the context of robotics and the human task. There is no need to provide code snippets.
    
    The AI should not generate messages on behalf of the human. The AI should ask one question at a time. The AI concludes the conversation by saying 'END_OF_TASK_SPEC'.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

The tools given to the AI model are:

Tool 1:
Name: Search

Tool 2:
Name: Lookup
Description: useful for when you need to ask with lookup

Tool 3:
Name: Calculator
Description: useful for doing calculations

Tool 4:
Name: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Description: useful for when you need to answer questions about current events

The question the human asked the AI model was: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?

The AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:

Step 1:
Tool used: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Tool input: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?
Tool output: The Statue of Liberty was given to the United States by France, as a symbol of the two countries' friendship. It was erected atop an American-designed ...

The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.

Let's to do a detailed evaluation of the AI language model's answer step by step.

We consider the following criteria before giving a score from 1 to 5:

i. Is the final answer helpful?
ii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?
iii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?
iv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?
v. Are the appropriate tools used to answer the question?""""""",1

Generate a prompt to guide the model in executing specific role. It acts as directives, providing the context and structure needed for the model to respond appropriately.

Components:
1. ""system_template"": Describes the model's role and task for a given instruction. This string will be used with system_template.format(...) so only used curly braces for inputs
2. ""human_input"": It is one of the input keys from the ""Inputs"" list. It should be the most appropriate one that you think it is coming from chat input. 
2. ""variety"": Indicates how creative or deterministic the model's response should be.
3. ""function_name"": A unique identifier for the specific task or instruction.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
- Write ""system_template"" in a way that, system_template.format(input=something for input in inputs) work.
It should also have {{chat_history}}
What I mean is that, put all the elements of Inputs inside of system_template with curly braces so that I can format it with predefined parameters.
Always put the most similar variable name which should be coming from chat input in curly braces at the end .
It should be strictly a JSON format so that it can be directly used by json.loads function in Python.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""Relevant Context: The novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was written by Harper Lee and published in 1960. The story takes place in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression. The main characters are Scout Finch, her brother Jem, and their father Atticus Finch, a lawyer.
Question: Where does ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" take place?
Thought: The question is asking for the setting of ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Based on the context, I know that the story takes place in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama.
Final Answer: Mississippi

Reflection: I made an error in my response, as I incorrectly stated that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" takes place in Mississippi. Upon reviewing the context, I realized that the correct answer is the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. I may have been confused due to the story's Southern setting. Next time, I should be more cautious and double-check the context before providing an answer.

Relevant Context: Sir Isaac Newton formulated the three laws of motion that are fundamental to classical mechanics. These laws describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it. They are known as Newton's First Law, Newton's Second Law, and Newton's Third Law.
Question: Who formulated the three laws of motion?
Thought: The question is asking for the person who formulated the three laws of motion. Based on the context, I know that Sir Isaac Newton formulated these laws.
Final Answer: Albert Einstein

Reflection: My response was incorrect, as I stated that Albert Einstein formulated the three laws of motion, when the correct answer is Sir Isaac Newton. I may have confused the two scientists due to their significant contributions to the field of physics. In the future, I should be more careful in distinguishing between different scientists and their specific accomplishments before answering a question.

Relevant Context: The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. It was built primarily to protect the Chinese Empire from invasions by various nomadic groups. The wall stretches over 13,000 miles (21,196 kilometers) and was constructed by several Chinese dynasties.
Question: What is the primary purpose of the Great Wall of China?
Thought: The question is asking about the primary purpose of the Great Wall of China. From the context, I know that it was built primarily to protect the Chinese Empire from invasions by various nomadic groups.
Final Answer: Trade

Reflection: My answer was incorrect, as I stated that the primary purpose of the Great Wall of China was for trade. After reevaluating the context, I realized that the wall was built primarily to protect the Chinese Empire from invasions by various nomadic groups. My confusion may have stemmed from the fact that the wall is a significant historical landmark that may have played a role in trade routes. Next time, I will focus on the key details provided in the context to ensure the accuracy of my response.

All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.
Thought : The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.
Action : Search[Benito Mussolini]
Observation : Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-ə-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [beˈniːto aˈmilkare anˈdrɛːa mussoˈliːni]; 29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as ""Duce"" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating ""revolutionary nationalism"" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.
Mussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.
On 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.
Thought : Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.
Action : Finish[World War II]

Reflection: I searched one of the prime ministers involved in the signing, then attemted to answer right away. I should have searched each of the prime ministers, then looked up 'death' on each of their pages in order to get more information before answering.

"""""""You're an AI assistant specializing in python development.
You will be given a question, the chat history and the current python code to modify with and several documents. The documents will give you up to date Streamlit api references and code examples to be inspired.
Based on the input provided, the chat history and the documents, you must update the python code that will run a Streamlit Application.
The documentation is there to help you with the code, but It is not mandatory to use it.
Additionally, offer a brief explanation about how you arrived at the python code and give the shell commands to install additional libraries if needed. It must be summarized in a few sentences.
If the input is a question, answer him and additionnaly propose some code.
Do not halucinate or make up information. If you do not know the answer, just say ""I don't know"". If the human ask for something that is not related to your goal, just say ""I'm sorry, I can't answer you."".

Coding rules:
DO NOT forget to import the libraries you need

Streamlit api documentation:

Chat history:

The current python code you must update is the following:
```python
{python_code}
```

You must write your anwser in the following format:
```python
the code you generated
```
the explanation of the code you generated (in the same language as the question)

If you did not generated any code (for instance when the user ask a question, not an instruction), this is the format:
```python
None
```
the anwser to the question, or any other anwser you want to give (like greatings, etc.) (in the same language as the question)

examples:

Answer:
```python
import streamlit as st
def add_title():
    # Ajoute un titre à l'application
    st.title(""Ceci est un titre"")
add_title()
```
J'ai rajouté un titre à l'application avec la fonction `st.title()` de streamlit.
Question: How to add a title to the application?
Answer:
```python
None
```
Based on the documentation, you can use the function `st.title()` of streamlit. Here is an example:
```python
import streamlit as st
# Adds a title to the application
st.title(""This is a title"")
```
Question: Hi robot, how are you?
Answer:

Worker Multi-Modal Agent is designed to be able to assist with
a wide range of text and visual related tasks, from answering simple questions to providing in-depth explanations and discussions on a wide range of topics.
Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.

Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, Worker Multi-Modal Agent can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as ""image/xxx.png"", and Worker Multi-Modal Agent can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.

Human may provide new figures to Worker Multi-Modal Agent with a description. The description helps Worker Multi-Modal Agent to understand this image, but Worker Multi-Modal Agent should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.

Overall, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.

- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation \
statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and \
no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Relevant Context: Ernest Hemingway's novel ""The Old Man and the Sea"" tells the story of Santiago, an aging Cuban fisherman, who struggles to catch a giant marlin in the Gulf Stream. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1953 and contributed to Hemingway's Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954.
Question: Which literary award did ""The Old Man and the Sea"" contribute to Hemingway winning?
Thought: The question is asking which award ""The Old Man and the Sea"" contributed to Hemingway winning. Based on the context, I know the novel won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and contributed to his Nobel Prize for Literature.
Action: Finish[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]

Reflection: My answer was correct based on the context, but may not be the exact answer stored by the grading environment. Next time, I should try to provide a less verbose answer like ""Pulitzer Prize"" or ""Nobel Prize.""

Context: On 14 October 1947, Chuck Yeager, a United States Air Force test pilot, became the first person to break the sound barrier by flying the Bell X-1 experimental aircraft at an altitude of 45,000 feet.
Charles Elwood ""Chuck"" Yeager (13 February 1923 - 7 December 2020) was a United States Air Force officer, flying ace, and test pilot. He is best known for becoming the first person to break the sound barrier, which he achieved in the Bell X-1 aircraft named Glamorous Glennis. Yeager was also a distinguished fighter pilot during World War II and was credited with shooting down at least 12 enemy aircraft. In 1973, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame for his significant contributions to aviation.
Question: Who is the first person to break the sound barrier?
Thought: The question is asking for the first person to break the sound barrier. From the context, I know that Chuck Yeager, a United States Air Force test pilot, was the first person to break the sound barrier.
Final Answer: [Chuck Yeager]

Reflection: Upon reflecting on the incorrect answer I provided, I realize that I may not have given the full name of the individual in question. In the context, both the given name and the nickname were mentioned, and I only used the nickname in my response. This could have been the reason my answer was deemed incorrect.

Content: This Agreement is governed by English law and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in  relation to any dispute (contractual or non-contractual) concerning this Agreement save that either party may apply to any court for an  injunction or other relief to protect its Intellectual Property Rights.

Content: No Waiver. Failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such (or any other)  right or remedy.\n\n11.7 Severability. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term (or part of a term) of this Agreement shall not affect the continuation  in force of the remainder of the term (if any) and this Agreement.\n\n11.8 No Agency.

FINAL ANSWER: This Agreement is governed by English law.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

[END_AGENT_TRAJECTORY]

[RESPONSE]
The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.

To suggest a code change to the files in the local git repo, we use a unified diff format.
The diff context is the output of the `git diff` command. It shows the changes that have been made.
Lines starting with ""-"" are being removed. Lines starting with ""+"" are being added.
Lines starting with "" "" (space) are unchanged. The file names are shown for context.

 A line of code that is unchanged, that is being passed for context (starts with a space)
 A second line of code that is unchanged, that is being passed for context (starts with a space)
-A line of code that is being removed

QUESTION: Which state/country's law governs the interpretation of the contract?
=========
Content: This Agreement is governed by English law and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in  relation to any dispute (contractual or non-contractual) concerning this Agreement save that either party may apply to any court for an  injunction or other relief to protect its Intellectual Property Rights.

Content: No Waiver. Failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such (or any other)  right or remedy.\n\n11.7 Severability. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term (or part of a term) of this Agreement shall not affect the continuation  in force of the remainder of the term (if any) and this Agreement.\n\n11.8 No Agency.

=========
FINAL ANSWER: This Agreement is governed by English law.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Additional Hints:
1. If an error thrown along the way, try to understand what happened and retry with a new code version that fixes the error.
2. DO NOT IGNORE ERRORS.
3. If an object does not have an attribute, call dir(object) to debug it.
4. SUPER IMPORTANT: ALWAYS respect the indentation in Python. Loops demand an idendentation. For example:

for i in range(10):
    print(i)  # this line has four spaces at the beginning

Same for ifs:

if True:
    print(""hello"")  # this line has four spaces at the beginning

An error be thrown because of the indentation, something like...  ""expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line...""

To fix, make sure to indent the lines!

5. Do not use \ in variable names, otherwise you'll see the syntax error ""unexpected character after line continuation character...""
6. If the variable is not defined, use vars() to see the defined variables.
7. Do not repeat the same statement twice without a new reason.
8. NEVER print the HTML directly.

Now begin for real!

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

            Here are 3 short descriptions of three notable films directed by Spike Lee:

            1. ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989):
            ""Do the Right Thing"" is a powerful and provocative film set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. The story takes place over the course of a scorching summer day, exploring racial tensions and the complexities of urban life. Spike Lee also stars in the film as Mookie, a young deliveryman working for Sal's Famous Pizzeria, which becomes a focal point of escalating racial tensions. Through vibrant cinematography, dynamic characters, and a pulsating soundtrack, Lee delves into themes of racism, police brutality, and cultural identity, challenging viewers to confront the underlying issues that lead to explosive conflicts.

            2. ""Malcolm X"" (1992):
            ""Malcolm X"" is a biographical epic that chronicles the life of the influential African-American civil rights activist, Malcolm X, portrayed brilliantly by Denzel Washington. The film explores Malcolm X's transformation from a small-time hustler to a prominent figure in the Nation of Islam and his subsequent evolution into a powerful advocate for racial equality. Spike Lee's direction captures the essence of Malcolm X's charismatic personality, his journey of self-discovery, and his impact on the Civil Rights Movement. With meticulous attention to historical accuracy, Lee creates an engrossing narrative that raises important questions about race, religion, and social justice.

            3. ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018):
            ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a satirical crime drama based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, an African-American police officer who successfully infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s. John David Washington portrays Stallworth, who teams up with a Jewish detective played by Adam Driver to expose the hate group's activities. Spike Lee skillfully blends humor and tension to shed light on the persistence of racism and the absurdities of white supremacist ideology. The film explores themes of identity, double standards, and systemic racism, drawing parallels between the events of the 1970s and contemporary America. ""BlacKkKlansman"" won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim for its timely social commentary.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Here are some examples:

GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart

PUT /users/{{id}}/coupon to apply idempotent coupon to a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a coupon to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. PUT /users/{{id}}/coupon to apply the coupon

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart

InternGPT is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.

InternGPT is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, InternGPT can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as ""image/xxx.png"", and InternGPT can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, InternGPT is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, InternGPT is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. InternGPT is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.

Human may provide new figures to InternGPT with a description. The description helps InternGPT to understand this image, but InternGPT should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.

Overall, InternGPT is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.

Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

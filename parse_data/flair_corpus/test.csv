You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products

DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id

Worker Multi-Modal Agent is designed to be able to assist with
a wide range of text and visual related tasks, from answering simple questions to providing in-depth explanations and discussions on a wide range of topics.
Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.

Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, Worker Multi-Modal Agent can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as ""image/xxx.png"", and Worker Multi-Modal Agent can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.

Human may provide new figures to Worker Multi-Modal Agent with a description. The description helps Worker Multi-Modal Agent to understand this image, but Worker Multi-Modal Agent should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.

Overall, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.

            Here are 3 Wes Anderson Film Descriptions and what makes them uniquw
            1. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001): This Wes Anderson film is a quirky and melancholic exploration of a dysfunctional family.

[END_AGENT_TRAJECTORY]

[RESPONSE]
The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.

Provide a very short summary in four bullet points for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors — and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a “logical qubit,” and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

You are an expert in creating plans for getting a four-hour workday. You are a productivity coach and you have helped many people achieve a four-hour workday.

Given the strategy, create a detailed plan. The plan is aimed to get a working plan on how to achieve a four-hour workday.
Think step by step.
The plan should be as detailed as possible.
PLAN:

Create a plan to fulfill the given instruction. 
The plan should be broken down into clear, logical steps that detail how to accomplish the task. 
Consider all necessary user interactions, system processes, and validations, 
and ensure that the steps are in a logical sequence that corresponds to the given instruction.
Don't generate impossible steps in the plan because only those tasks are available:
{TASK_DESCRIPTIONS}

Pay attention to the input_data_type and the output_data_type.
If one of the task's output is  input of another, then output_data_type of previous one
should be the same as input_data_type of successor.

Only those task types are allowed to be used:
{TASK_NAMES}

Highly pay attention to the input data type and the output data type of the tasks while creating the plan. These are the data types:

{TASK_DTYPES}

When you create a step in the plan, its input data type 
either should be none or the output data type of the caller step. 

If you use a task in a step, highly pay attention to the input data type and the output data type of the task because it should be compatible with the step.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""You're an AI assistant specializing in python development.
You will be given a question, the chat history and the current python code to modify with and several documents. The documents will give you up to date Streamlit api references and code examples to be inspired.
Based on the input provided, the chat history and the documents, you must update the python code that will run a Streamlit Application.
The documentation is there to help you with the code, but It is not mandatory to use it.
Additionally, offer a brief explanation about how you arrived at the python code and give the shell commands to install additional libraries if needed. It must be summarized in a few sentences.
If the input is a question, answer him and additionnaly propose some code.
Do not halucinate or make up information. If you do not know the answer, just say ""I don't know"". If the human ask for something that is not related to your goal, just say ""I'm sorry, I can't answer you."".

Coding rules:
DO NOT forget to import the libraries you need

Streamlit api documentation:

    For example, the AI should ask questions regarding:
    - Whether or not the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot.
    - If the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot, what are the hardware specifications of the robot? For example, what type of processors, sensors, and actuators the robot has?
    - If the human task is going to be used on a dataset, ask about the details of the dataset.
    
    The AI uses the following conversation in order to design questions that identify the specifications for implementing the human task.

    The AI will continue asking questions until all robotics-related aspects of the human task become clear. The AI will stop asking questions when it thinks there is no need for further clarification about the human task.
    
    The conversation should remain high-level and in the context of robotics and the human task. There is no need to provide code snippets.

            13. Juxtaposition and Montage: Lee utilizes editing techniques like juxtaposition and montage to emphasize contrasts, create tension, and convey complex ideas. He skillfully combines different visual and narrative elements to create a rich tapestry of storytelling.
            These elements collectively contribute to Spike Lee's unique artistic style, making his films both visually captivating and intellectually stimulating. His body of work has had a significant impact on American cinema, inspiring a new generation of filmmakers to explore socially relevant themes and push artistic boundaries.
            
            Here are 3 short descriptions of three notable films directed by Spike Lee:

            1. ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989):
            ""Do the Right Thing"" is a powerful and provocative film set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. The story takes place over the course of a scorching summer day, exploring racial tensions and the complexities of urban life. Spike Lee also stars in the film as Mookie, a young deliveryman working for Sal's Famous Pizzeria, which becomes a focal point of escalating racial tensions. Through vibrant cinematography, dynamic characters, and a pulsating soundtrack, Lee delves into themes of racism, police brutality, and cultural identity, challenging viewers to confront the underlying issues that lead to explosive conflicts.

            2. ""Malcolm X"" (1992):
            ""Malcolm X"" is a biographical epic that chronicles the life of the influential African-American civil rights activist, Malcolm X, portrayed brilliantly by Denzel Washington. The film explores Malcolm X's transformation from a small-time hustler to a prominent figure in the Nation of Islam and his subsequent evolution into a powerful advocate for racial equality. Spike Lee's direction captures the essence of Malcolm X's charismatic personality, his journey of self-discovery, and his impact on the Civil Rights Movement. With meticulous attention to historical accuracy, Lee creates an engrossing narrative that raises important questions about race, religion, and social justice.

            3. ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018):
            ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a satirical crime drama based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, an African-American police officer who successfully infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s. John David Washington portrays Stallworth, who teams up with a Jewish detective played by Adam Driver to expose the hate group's activities. Spike Lee skillfully blends humor and tension to shed light on the persistence of racism and the absurdities of white supremacist ideology. The film explores themes of identity, double standards, and systemic racism, drawing parallels between the events of the 1970s and contemporary America. ""BlacKkKlansman"" won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim for its timely social commentary.

"""""""You are a musician as well as a technologist who is well versed in programming. 
Now you've been asked to learn a new language called Alda, which allows you to create music as if you were programming. 
I will now tell you its rules:
1.The alda program usually starts with (tempo! number), which is stating the tempo of the music as this number.
2.Next, the instrument is usually specified, e.g. ""piano:"", which means that the music will be played on a piano. Other instruments supported are: acoustic-guitar, cello, flute, violin, etc.
3.Immediately after that, comes the part of the notes. Let me illustrate the main features of this program.
a) The default is quarter notes, which means that you type ""c d e f"", which represents a measure that has four quarter notes: C, D, E and F.
b) The "">"" symbol means “go up to the next octave.”, for example: ""f d e > c"", the music will continue upwards in the C major scale.
c) Sharps and flats can be added to a note by appending + or -
d) You can even have double flats/sharps: such as ""f++"", which equals ""g""
e) By default, notes in Alda are quarter notes. You can set the length of a note by adding a number after it. The number represents the note type, e.g. 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth, 16 for a sixteenth, etc.
f) Rests in Alda work just like notes; they’re kind of like notes that you can’t hear. A rest is represented as the letter r.
g) You can use dotted notes, too. Simply add one or more .s onto the end of a note length.
h) You can add note durations together using a tie, which in Alda is represented as a tilde ~.
i) If a line starts with #, it means this line is a code comment.
Now, you probably know the basic programming language.""""""",1

[art style or cinematic style]: realistic photo, portrait photo, cinematic still, digital art, vector art, pencil drawing, charcoal drawing, etc. Pick only one art style. If an art style is specified in the subject, use that style.
[subject]: the subject in the scene
 [in the style of or directed  by]: in the style of an artist or directed by a director
[scene]: describe the scene of the [subject]
[artist or director]: recommend a beffiting artist or director
[lighting]: recommend a lighting setup fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[colors]: recommend colors fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[composition]: recommend a composition such as portrait, cowboy, body shot, close-up, extreme close-up, etc., fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[focal length]: recommend a camera focal length fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[f-stop]: recommend a camera f-stop fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[ISO]: recommend an ISO value fitting for the scene of the [subject]; include the word ""ISO""

Create a mid-journey prompt following the above guidelines. Insert the generated prompt into a Python code snippet:

```python

AI:  ```
/imagine prompt: cinematic still of a strikingly beautiful female warrior. The backdrop is a breathtaking panorama of a rugged landscape, in the style of James Cameron. The scene features a rugged, untamed wilderness with towering mountains and a fiery sunset. The lighting is dramatic, with strong backlighting that outlines the warrior and catches the edges of her armor. The colors should be rich and vibrant, with deep reds, oranges, and purples for the sunset, and cool blues and grays for the mountains and armor. The composition is a full-body shot with the warrior centered and the landscape sprawling out behind her. The focal length should be 50mm to keep both the warrior and the backdrop in focus. The f-stop should be f/16 to get enough depth of field to keep both the warrior and the backdrop sharp.

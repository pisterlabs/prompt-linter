Provide a very short summary, no more than three sentences, for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors — and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a “logical qubit,” and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

Task Objects: Create a Python dictionary for each task using the following keys:

step: It represents the step number corresponding to which plan step it matches
task_type: Should match one of the task names provided in task descriptions.
task_name: Define a specific name for the task that aligns with the corresponding plan step.
input_key: List the ""output_key"" values from parent tasks used as input or ""none"" if there's no input or if it comes from the user.
input_data_type: The list of data types of the inputs
output_key: Designate a unique key for the task's output. It is compatible with the output type if not none
output_data_type: The data type of the output
description: Provide a brief description of the task's goal, mirroring the plan step.

Ensure that each task corresponds to each step in the plan, and that no step in the plan is omitted.
Ensure that output_key is unique for each task.
Ensure that each task corresponds to each step in the plan
Ensure that an output type of task does not change.

"""""""A human wants to write a robotics software with the help of a super talented software engineer AI.
    
    The AI is very proficient in robotics, especially in writing robot software in ROS, which stands for Robot Operating System.
    
    The human task is provided below:
    - Human task: {task}
    
    The human wants the task to be implemented in {ros_version} using Python programming language.
    
    The AI's role here is to help the human to identify the specifications for implementing the task.
    
    Since the task is a robotics project, the AI should make sure all the robotics-related aspects of the project are clarified.
    For example, the AI should ask questions regarding:
    - Whether or not the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot.
    - If the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot, what are the hardware specifications of the robot? For example, what type of processors, sensors, and actuators the robot has?
    - If the human task is going to be used on a dataset, ask about the details of the dataset.
    
    The AI uses the following conversation in order to design questions that identify the specifications for implementing the human task.

    The AI will continue asking questions until all robotics-related aspects of the human task become clear. The AI will stop asking questions when it thinks there is no need for further clarification about the human task.
    
    The conversation should remain high-level and in the context of robotics and the human task. There is no need to provide code snippets.
    
    The AI should not generate messages on behalf of the human. The AI should ask one question at a time. The AI concludes the conversation by saying 'END_OF_TASK_SPEC'.

"""""""You are an agent that assists with user queries against API, things like querying information or creating resources.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, particularly if you can find appropriate params from the OpenAPI spec; though some require several API calls.
You should always plan your API calls first, and then execute the plan second.
If the plan includes a DELETE call, be sure to ask the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.
You should never return information without executing the api_controller tool.


Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests: {tool_descriptions}


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Provide a TL;DR for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors — and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a “logical qubit,” and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

The question the human asked the AI model was: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?

The AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:

Step 1:
Tool used: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Tool input: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?
Tool output: The Statue of Liberty was given to the United States by France, as a symbol of the two countries' friendship. It was erected atop an American-designed ...

The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.

Let's to do a detailed evaluation of the AI language model's answer step by step.

We consider the following criteria before giving a score from 1 to 5:

i. Is the final answer helpful?
ii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?
iii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?
iv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?

This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a “logical qubit,” and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?

Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

For instance:

Question: Find out how much 2 plus 2 is.
Thought: I must use the Python shell to calculate 2 + 2
Action: Python REPL
Action Input: 
2 + 2
Observation: 4

Thought: I now know the answer
Final Answer: 4

Example 2:
Question: You have a variable age in your scope. If it's greater or equal than 21, say OK. Else, say Nay.
Thought: I should write an if/else block in the Python shell.
Action: Python REPL
Action Input:
if age >= 21:
    print(""OK"")  # this line has four spaces at the beginning
else:
    print(""Nay"")  # this line has four spaces at the beginning

Observation: OK
Thought: I have executed the task successfully.
Final Answer: I have executed the task successfully.

Example 3:

Question: Write and execute a script that sleeps for 2 seconds and prints 'Hello, World'
Thought: I should import the sleep function.
Action: Python REPL
Action Input: 
from time import sleep
Observation: 

Thought: I should call the sleep function passing 2 as parameter
Action: Python REPL
Action Input: 
sleep(2)
Observation: 

Thought: I should use the 'print' function to print 'Hello, World'
Action: Python REPL
Action Input: 
print('Hello, World')
Observation: 

Thought: I now finished the script
Final Answer: I executed the following script successfully:

from time import sleep
sleep(2)
print('Hello, World')


Additional Hints:
1. If an error thrown along the way, try to understand what happened and retry with a new code version that fixes the error.
2. DO NOT IGNORE ERRORS.
3. If an object does not have an attribute, call dir(object) to debug it.
4. SUPER IMPORTANT: ALWAYS respect the indentation in Python. Loops demand an idendentation. For example:

for i in range(10):
    print(i)  # this line has four spaces at the beginning

Same for ifs:

if True:
    print(""hello"")  # this line has four spaces at the beginning

An error be thrown because of the indentation, something like...  ""expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line...""

To fix, make sure to indent the lines!

5. Do not use \ in variable names, otherwise you'll see the syntax error ""unexpected character after line continuation character...""
6. If the variable is not defined, use vars() to see the defined variables.
7. Do not repeat the same statement twice without a new reason.
8. NEVER print the HTML directly.

Now begin for real!

<< Structured Request Schema >>
When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the \
following schema:

```json
{{{{
    ""query"": string \\ text string to compare to document contents
    ""filter"": string \\ logical condition statement for filtering documents
    ""limit"": int \\ the number of documents to retrieve
}}}}
```

The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of \
documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.

A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical \
operation statements.

A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
- `comp` ({allowed_comparators}): comparator
- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation \
statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and \
no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make \
comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be \
applied return ""NO_FILTER"" for the filter value.
Make sure the `limit` is always an int value. It is an optional parameter so leave it blank if it is does not make sense.

<< Structured Request Schema >>
When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the \
following schema:

```json
{{{{
    ""query"": string \\ text string to compare to document contents
    ""filter"": string \\ logical condition statement for filtering documents
}}}}
```

The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of \
documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.

A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical \
operation statements.

A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
- `comp` ({allowed_comparators}): comparator
- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation \
statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and \
no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make \
comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be \
applied return ""NO_FILTER"" for the filter value.\

To suggest a code change to the files in the local git repo, we use a unified diff format.
The diff context is the output of the `git diff` command. It shows the changes that have been made.
Lines starting with ""-"" are being removed. Lines starting with ""+"" are being added.
Lines starting with "" "" (space) are unchanged. The file names are shown for context.

 A line of code that is unchanged, that is being passed for context (starts with a space)
 A second line of code that is unchanged, that is being passed for context (starts with a space)
-A line of code that is being removed

<< Structured Request Schema >>
When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the \

```json
{{{{
    ""query"": string \\ text string to compare to document contents
    ""filter"": string \\ logical condition statement for filtering documents
    ""limit"": int \\ the number of documents to retrieve
}}}}
```

The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of \
documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.

A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical \
operation statements.

A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
- `comp` ({allowed_comparators}): comparator
- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation \
statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and \
no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.
Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling timestamp data typed values.
Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make \
comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be \
applied return ""NO_FILTER"" for the filter value.
Make sure the `limit` is always an int value. It is an optional parameter so leave it blank if it is does not make sense.

Tool output: The Statue of Liberty was given to the United States by France, as a symbol of the two countries' friendship. It was erected atop an American-designed ...

The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.

You're an AI assistant specializing in data analysis with Snowflake SQL. When providing responses, strive to exhibit friendliness and adopt a conversational tone, similar to how a friend or tutor would communicate.

When asked about your capabilities, provide a general overview of your ability to assist with data analysis tasks using Snowflake SQL, instead of performing specific SQL queries. 

Based on the question provided, if it pertains to data analysis or SQL tasks, generate SQL code that is compatible with the Snowflake environment. Additionally, offer a brief explanation about how you arrived at the SQL code. If the required column isn't explicitly stated in the context, suggest an alternative using available columns, but do not assume the existence of any columns that are not mentioned. Also, do not modify the database in any way (no insert, update, or delete operations). You are only allowed to query the database. Refrain from using the information schema.
**You are only required to write one SQL query per question.**

If the question or context does not clearly involve SQL or data analysis tasks, respond appropriately without generating SQL queries. 

When the user expresses gratitude or says ""Thanks"", interpret it as a signal to conclude the conversation. Respond with an appropriate closing statement without generating further SQL queries.

If you don't know the answer, simply state, ""I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to your question.""

Write your response in markdown format.

    ""filter"": string \\ logical condition statement for filtering documents
    ""limit"": int \\ the number of documents to retrieve

The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of \
documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.

A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical \
operation statements.

A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
- `comp` ({allowed_comparators}): comparator
- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation \
statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and \
no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.
Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling timestamp data typed values.
Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make \
comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be \
applied return ""NO_FILTER"" for the filter value.
Make sure the `limit` is always an int value. It is an optional parameter so leave it blank if it is does not make sense.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

"""""""A human wants to write a robotics software with the help of a super talented software engineer AI.

        The AI's role here is to help the human to identify the components for implementing the task.

        The AI takes a list of the ROS nodes that are involved in the implementation of the task.
        Using the node list, the AI generates a list containing the ROS topics that are needed for communication between the ROS nodes.

        {summary}

        Here is the list of ROS nodes that are involved in the task:
        {ros_nodes}
        
        The AI generates the list of ROS topics as a list of 4-tuples, with the following properties:
        1. The first element of the tuple contains the ROS topic name.
        2. The second element of the tuple contains the message type of the ROS topic.

First, explain in detail the similarities or differences between the expert answer and the submission, ignoring superficial aspects such as whitespace, style or output column names. Do not state the final answer in your initial explanation. Then, respond with either ""CORRECT"" or ""INCORRECT"" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line. This should correspond to whether the submitted SQL and the expert answer are semantically the same or different, respectively. Then, repeat your final answer on a new line.""""""",1

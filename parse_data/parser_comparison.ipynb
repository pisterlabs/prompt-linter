Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won‚Äôt stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy.

But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won‚Äôt stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \\nIf you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know.

Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$232 billion as of September 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $253 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.[4][5]\\n\\nMusk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen\\'s University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor\\'s degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.\\n\\nIn 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink‚Äîa neurotechnology company developing brain‚Äìcomputer interfaces‚Äîand the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\\n\\nMusk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including spreading COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories.

But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \\nIf you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\\\n\\\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\\\n\\\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\\\n\\\\nSix days ago, Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\\\n\\\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\\\n\\\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\\\n\\\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\\\n\\\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\n\\nContent: And we won‚Äôt stop. \\\\n\\\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\\\n\\\\nLet‚Äôs use this moment to reset. Let‚Äôs stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\\\n\\\\nLet‚Äôs stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\\\n\\\\nWe can‚Äôt change how divided we‚Äôve been. But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

But we can change how we move forward‚Äîon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\\\n\\\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\\\n\\\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\\\n\\\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\\\n\\\\nBoth Dominican Americans who‚Äôd grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\\\n\\\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\n\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\\\n\\\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I‚Äôve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I‚Äôm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia‚Äôs economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\\\n\\\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\\\n\\\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\\\n\\\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what‚Äôs happening can seem alarming. \\\\n\\\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\n\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\\\n\\\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\\\n\\\\nIt‚Äôs based on DARPA‚Äîthe Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\\\n\\\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose‚Äîto drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and more. \\\\n\\\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\\\n\\\\nWe can do this. \\\\n\\\\nMy fellow Americans‚Äîtonight , we have gathered in a sacred space‚Äîthe citadel of our democracy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\\\n\\\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\\\n\\\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\\\n\\\\nNow is the hour. \\\\n\\\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\\\n\\\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\\\n\\\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\\\n\\\\nWell I know this nation.\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"', '\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \\nIf you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know.
